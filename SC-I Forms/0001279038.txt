to $100,000,000 in interests in the Fund (the &quot;Interests&quot;) or portions
thereof pursuant to tenders by investors at a price equal to their estimated net
asset value as of December 31, 2005, if the Offer expires on December 21, 2005.
If the Fund elects to extend the tender period for any reason, for the purpose
of determining the purchase price for tendered Interests, the estimated net
asset value of such Interests will be determined at the close of business on the
last business day of the month in which the tender offer actually expires. (As
used in this Offer, the term &quot;Interest,&quot; or &quot;Interests,&quot; as
the context requires, shall refer to the interests in the Fund and portions
thereof representing beneficial interests in the Fund.) This Offer is being made
to all investors of the Fund and is not conditioned on any minimum amount of
Interests being tendered, but is subject to certain conditions described below.
Interests are not traded on any established trading market and are subject to
strict restrictions on transferability pursuant to the Fund's Limited Liability
Company Agreement dated as of June 7, 2004 (the &quot;L.L.C. Agreement&quot;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors should realize
that the value of the Interests tendered in this Offer likely will change
between October 31, 2005 (the last time estimated net asset value was
calculated), November 30, 2005 (the next time estimated net asset value will be
calculated) and December 31, 2005, when the value of the Interests tendered to
the Fund will be determined for purposes of calculating the purchase price of
such Interests. Investors should also note that although the tender offer
expires on December 21, 2005, they remain investors in the Fund until December
31, 2005, when the estimated net asset value of their Interests is calculated.
The Fund determines the estimated net asset value at least monthly and may
determine the estimated net asset value more frequently. Any tendering investors
that wish to obtain the most current estimated net asset value of their
Interests on this basis should contact the Fund&#146;s Administrator, PFPC Inc.
(&#147;PFPC&#148;), at the telephone number or address set forth below, Monday
through Friday, except holidays, during normal business hours of 9:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors desiring to
tender all or any portion of their Interest in the Fund in accordance with the
terms of the Offer should complete and sign the attached Letter of Transmittal

forth below. </FONT></P>

the estimated net asset value as of December 31, 2005. We will owe you the
balance, for which we will give you a promissory note that will be held for you
by PFPC. If you tender part of your interest, leaving a remainder at least equal
to $50,000 ($25,000 for certain eligible investors who are identified in the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Background and Purpose of the
Offer.</B> The purpose of the Offer is to provide liquidity to investors who hold
Interests as contemplated by and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Fund's Prospectus dated as of May 2, 2005, as supplemented (the
"Prospectus"), and the L.L.C. Agreement. The Prospectus as then in effect and
the L.L.C. Agreement, which were provided to each investor in advance of
subscribing for Interests, provide that the Directors have the discretion to
determine whether the Fund will repurchase Interests from investors from time to
time pursuant to written tenders. The Prospectus also states that UBS Fund
Advisor, L.L.C., the adviser of the Fund (the "Adviser"), expects that generally
it will recommend to the Directors that the Fund repurchase Interests from
investors twice each year, near mid-year and year-end. Because there is no
secondary trading market for Interests and transfers of Interests are prohibited
without prior approval of the Fund, the Directors have determined, after
consideration of various matters, including, but not limited to, those set forth
in the Prospectus, that the Offer is in the best interests of investors of the
Fund to provide liquidity for Interests as contemplated in the Prospectus and
the L.L.C. Agreement. The Directors intend to consider the continued
desirability of the Fund making an offer to purchase Interests twice each year
(currently anticipated to be near mid year and year end), but the Fund is not
required to make any such offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purchase of Interests
pursuant to the Offer will have the effect of decreasing the size of the Fund
and increasing the proportionate interest in the Fund of investors who do not
tender Interests. A reduction in the aggregate assets of the Fund may result in
investors who do not tender Interests bearing higher costs to the extent that
certain expenses borne by the Fund are relatively fixed and may not decrease if
assets decline. These effects may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that
additional subscriptions for Interests are made from time to time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interests that are tendered
to the Fund in connection with this Offer will be retired, although the Fund may
issue new Interests from time to time. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Offer to Purchase and Price.</B>
The Fund will purchase, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer, up to $100,000,000 of those outstanding Interests that are properly
tendered by and not withdrawn (in accordance with Section 5 below) before 12:00
midnight, New York time, on December 21, 2005 (such time and date being
hereinafter called the "Initial Expiration Date"). If the Fund elects to extend
the tender period for any reason, for the purpose of determining the purchase
price for tendered Interests, the estimated net asset value of such Interests
will be determined at the close of business on the last business day of the
month in which the tender offer actually expires. The later of the Initial
Expiration Date or the latest time and date to which the Offer is extended
hereinafter is called the "Expiration Date." The Fund reserves the right to
extend, amend or cancel the Offer as described in Sections 3 and 7 below. The
purchase price of an Interest tendered will be its estimated net asset value as
of the close of business on the last day of the month in which the Expiration
Date occurs, payable as set forth in Section 6. The table below shows the
estimated unaudited net asset value, as of November 1, 2005, of an initial
capital contribution of $250,000 made as of the dates on which initial
investments in the Fund were accepted:</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the close of business
on November 1, 2005, there were approximately $150,873,419 outstanding in
capital of the Fund held in Interests (based on the unaudited estimated net
asset value of such Interests). The Fund determines its estimated net asset
value at least monthly and may determine its estimated net asset value more
frequently. Investors may obtain the most current information regarding the
estimated net asset value of their Interests by contacting PFPC, at the
telephone number or address set forth on page 2, Monday through Friday, except
holidays, during normal business hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time).
Of course, the estimated value of the Interests tendered by the investors likely
will change between October 31, 2005 (the last time estimated net asset value
was calculated), November 30, 2005 (the next time it will be calculated) and
December 31, 2005, when the value of the Interests tendered by investors will be
determined for purposes of calculating the purchase price of such Interests and
the time that investors will cease to be investors in the Fund. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Amount of Tender.</B> Subject to the
limitations set forth below, investors may tender their entire Interest or a
portion of their Interest. However, an investor who tenders for repurchase only
a portion of such investor's Interest shall be required to maintain a capital
account balance equal to $50,000 ($25,000 for certain eligible investors who are
identified in the Fund's Prospectus). If an investor tenders an amount that
would cause the investor's capital account balance to fall below the required
minimum, the Fund reserves the right to reduce the amount to be purchased from
such investor so that the required minimum balance is maintained. The Offer is
being made to all investors of the Fund and is not conditioned on any minimum
amount of Interests being tendered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the amount of the
Interests that are properly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn
pursuant to Section 5 below is less than or equal to $100,000,000 (or such
greater amount as the Fund may elect to purchase pursuant to the Offer), the
Fund will, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, purchase all
of the Interests so tendered unless the Fund elects to cancel or amend the
Offer, or postpone acceptance of tenders made pursuant to the Offer, as provided
in Section 7 below. If more than $100,000,000 in Interests are duly tendered to
the Fund before the expiration of the Offer and not withdrawn pursuant to
Section 5 below, the Fund will, in its sole discretion, either (a) accept the
additional Interests permitted to be accepted pursuant to Rule 13e-4(f)(1)(ii)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; (b) extend the Offer, if
necessary, and increase the amount of Interests that the Fund is offering to
purchase to an amount it believes sufficient to accommodate the excess Interests
tendered as well as any Interests tendered during the extended Offer; or (c)
accept Interests tendered on or before the Expiration Date for payment on a pro
rata basis based on the aggregate estimated net asset value of tendered
Interests. The Offer may be extended, amended or canceled in various other
circumstances described in Section 7 below. The Adviser beneficially owns
$101,101 in Interests and does not intend to tender in the Offer. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Procedure for Tenders.</B>
Investors wishing to tender Interests pursuant to the Offer should mail a
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal (the last page will suffice) to
PFPC, to the attention of Tender Offer Administrator, at the address set forth
on page 2, or fax a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to PFPC, also
to the attention of Tender Offer Administrator, at the fax numbers set forth on
page 2. The completed and executed Letter of Transmittal must be received by
PFPC, either by mail or by fax, no later than the Expiration Date. The Fund
recommends that all documents be submitted to PFPC by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by facsimile transmission. An investor choosing to fax a
Letter of Transmittal to PFPC must also mail the original completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal (the last page will suffice) to PFPC promptly thereafter.
If an investor elects to tender, it is the tendering investor's responsibility
to confirm receipt of the Letter of Transmittal or other document with
PFPC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors wishing to
confirm receipt of a Letter of Transmittal may contact PFPC at the address and
phone number set forth on page 2. The&#160;method of delivery of any documents
is at the election and complete risk of the investor tendering an Interest,
including, but not limited to, the failure of PFPC to receive any Letter of
Transmittal or other document. All questions as to the validity, form,
eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of tenders will be
determined by the Fund, in its sole discretion, and such determination shall be
final and binding. The Fund reserves the absolute right to reject any or all
tenders determined by it not to be in appropriate form or the acceptance of or
payment for which would, in the opinion of counsel for the Fund, be unlawful.
The Fund also reserves the absolute right to waive any of the conditions of the
Offer or any defect in any tender with respect to any particular Interest or any
particular investor, and the Fund's interpretation of the terms and conditions
of the Offer will be final and binding. Unless waived, any defects or
irregularities in connection with tenders must be cured within such time as the
Fund shall determine. Tenders will not be deemed to have been made until the
defects or irregularities have been cured or waived. Neither the Fund nor the
Adviser nor Directors of the Fund shall be obligated to give notice of any
defects or irregularities in tenders, nor shall any of them incur any liability
for failure to give such notice. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Withdrawal Rights.</B> Any
investor tendering an Interest pursuant to this Offer may withdraw its tender at
any time on or before the Expiration Date and, if Interests have not then been
accepted by the Fund, at any time after January 23, 2006. To be effective, any
notice of withdrawal must be timely received by PFPC at the address or fax
numbers set forth on page 2. A form to use to give notice of withdrawal is
available by calling PFPC at the phone number indicated on page 2. All questions
as to the form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal
will be determined by the Fund, in its sole discretion, and such determination
shall be final and binding. Interests properly withdrawn shall not thereafter be
deemed to be tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Interests
may be tendered prior to the Expiration Date by following the procedures
described in Section 4.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Purchases and Payment.</B> For
purposes of the Offer, the Fund will be deemed to have accepted (and thereby
purchased) Interests that are tendered as, if and when it gives oral or written
notice to the tendering investor of its election to purchase such Interest. As
stated in Section 2 above, the purchase price of an Interest tendered by any
investor will be the estimated net asset value thereof as of the close of
business on December 31, 2005, if the Offer expires on the Initial Expiration
Date. If the Fund elects to extend the tender period for any reason, for the
purpose of determining the purchase price for tendered Interests, the estimated
net asset value of such Interests will be determined at the close of business on
the last business day of the month in which the tender offer actually expires.
The estimated net asset value will be determined after all allocations to
capital accounts of the investors required to be made by the L.L.C. Agreement
have been made.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For investors who tender
their entire Interest, payment of the purchase price will consist of: (1) cash
in an aggregate amount equal to 90% of the estimated unaudited net asset value
of Interests tendered by the investor and accepted by the Fund, determined as of
December 31, 2005, payable by January 9, 2006 (the &quot;90% Cash Payment&quot;)
and (2)&#160;a promissory note (the &quot;Note&quot;), entitling the holder
thereof to a contingent payment equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the net
asset value of the Interests tendered by the investor and accepted by the Fund
as of the Expiration Date, determined as of December 31, 2005, based on the
audited financial statements of the Fund for calendar year 2005, over (b) the
90% Cash Payment. The Note will be held for each tendering investor by PFPC as
set forth below, will be prepared within approximately ten days after the Fund's
estimated net asset value is calculated and will not be transferable. The Note
will be payable in cash (in the manner set forth below) within approximately ten
days after completion of the audit of the financial statements of the Fund for
calendar year 2005, or on such earlier date as the Fund's Directors may
determine. It is anticipated that the audit of the Fund's financial statements
for calendar year 2005 will be completed by no later than 60 days after the end
of the year. Any amounts payable under the Note will include interest, if any,
earned by the Fund on an amount, deposited by the Fund in a segregated custodial
account, equal to 10% of the estimated unaudited net asset value of Interests
tendered by the investor and accepted by the Fund. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors who tender a
portion of their Interests (subject to maintenance of a minimum capital account
balance) will receive cash in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the estimated
unaudited net asset value of Interests tendered by the investor and accepted by
the Fund, determined as of December 31, 2005, payable by January 9, 2006 (the
&quot;100% Cash Payment&quot;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the 90% Cash Payment
and the 100% Cash Payment (together, the &quot;Cash Payment&quot;) will be made
by wire transfer directly to the tendering investor's brokerage account with UBS
Financial Services Inc. (&quot;UBS Financial Services&quot;), if such investor
has a UBS Financial Services account. Cash Payments wired directly to brokerage
accounts will be subject upon withdrawal from such accounts to any fees that UBS
Financial Services would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from
such brokerage account. If such investor does not have a UBS Financial Services
account, the Cash Payment will be sent directly to its mailing address as listed
in the Fund's records, unless such investor advises the Fund in writing of a
change in its mailing address. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Note will be held for
each investor by PFPC. Any contingent payment due pursuant to the Note will be
deposited directly to the tendering investor's brokerage account at UBS
Financial Services if such investor has a UBS Financial Services account, and
will be subject upon withdrawal from such account to any fees that UBS Financial
Services would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from such
brokerage account. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund expects that the
purchase price for Interests acquired pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, which
will not exceed $100,000,000 (unless the Fund elects, in its sole and absolute
discretion, to purchase a greater amount), will be derived from: (1) cash on
hand; (2) the proceeds of the sale of and/or delivery of securities and
portfolio assets held by the Fund; and/or (3) possibly borrowings, as described
below. The Fund will segregate, with its custodian, cash or U.S. government
securities or other liquid securities equal to the value of the amount estimated
to be paid under any Notes as described above. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund currently is party
to a Credit Agreement, dated July 2, 2004, among Harris Trust and Savings Bank,
the Fund and several other funds in the UBS Alternative Investment Group, as
amended (the &quot;Credit Agreement&quot;). Under the Credit Agreement, the Fund
may borrow from time to time on a revolving basis at any time up to the lesser
of (a) an amount equal to 20% of the Fund's total eligible asset value (as
defined in the Credit Agreement), (b) an amount equal to 33 1/3% of the fair
market value of the Fund's total assets (as defined in the Credit Agreement),
(c) the maximum amount permitted by the Fund's offering documents, government
officials and applicable law and (d) $150,000,000. If the Fund determines to
borrow in order to fund all or a portion of the purchase price of the Interests
purchased in the Offer, the Fund expects that such borrowings would be made
pursuant to the Credit Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount
currently available to all borrowers under the Credit Agreement is $150,000,000
in the aggregate, all of which is available for borrowing. To the extent that
the demand for loans exceeds the amount available under the Credit Agreement the
loans are to be allocated among the borrowers pro rata based upon the fair
market value of the borrowers' total assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indebtedness outstanding
under the&#160;Credit Agreement accrues interest at a rate of 1.5% over the
Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect, or at 3.5% over such rate on
amounts not paid when due. Interest is payable quarterly on the last day of
March, June, September and December. The principal amount of any loan
outstanding under the Credit Agreement, together with any interest accrued
thereon, is due on June 30, 2006. The Credit Agreement also contains a number of
other representations and warranties, covenants and conditions to each borrowing
that are typical of commercial revolving credit agreements. Obligations of each
of the borrowers under the Credit Agreement are several and not joint.&#160;
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is not secured by any lien on the assets
of the Fund. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of any
borrowings under the Credit Agreement would depend upon the amount of Interests
tendered and prevailing general, economic and market conditions.&#160; If the
Fund borrows under the Credit Agreement to pay for Interests purchased in the
Offer, the Fund expects that such borrowings would be repaid from funds received
from time to time in the ordinary course upon sales of Interests or sale of the
Fund's investments. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Certain Conditions of the
Offer.</B> The Fund reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, to extend
the period of time during which the Offer is pending by notifying investors of
such extension. If the Fund elects to extend the tender period for any reason,
for the purpose of determining the purchase price for tendered Interests, the
estimated net asset value of such Interests will be determined at the close of
business on the last business day of the month in which the tender offer
actually expires. During any such extension, all Interests previously tendered
and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer. The Fund also reserves the
right, at any time and from time to time, up to and including acceptance of
tenders pursuant to the Offer, to: (a) cancel the Offer in the circumstances set
forth in the following paragraph and in the event of such cancellation, not to
purchase or pay for any Interests tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b) amend the
Offer; or (c) postpone the acceptance of Interests. If the Fund determines to
amend the Offer or to postpone the acceptance of Interests tendered, it will, to
the extent necessary, extend the period of time during which the Offer is open
as provided above and will promptly notify investors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund may cancel the
Offer, amend the Offer or postpone the acceptance of tenders made pursuant to
the Offer if: (a) the Fund would not be able to liquidate portfolio securities
in a manner that is orderly and consistent with the Fund's investment objectives
and policies in order to purchase Interests tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b)
there is, in the Directors' judgment, any (i) legal action or proceeding
instituted or threatened challenging the Offer or that otherwise would have a
material adverse affect on the Fund, (ii) declaration of a banking moratorium by
Federal or state authorities or any suspension of payment by banks in the United
States or New York State that is material to the Fund, (iii) limitation imposed
by Federal or state authorities on the extension of credit by lending
institutions, (iv) suspension of trading on any organized exchange or
over-the-counter market where the Fund has a material investment, (v)
commencement of war, armed hostilities or other international or national
calamity directly or indirectly involving the United States that is material to
the Fund, (vi) material decrease in the estimated net asset value of the Fund
from the estimated net asset value of the Fund as of the commencement of the
Offer, or (vii)&#160;other event or condition that would have a material adverse
effect on the Fund or its investors if Interests tendered pursuant to the Offer
were purchased; or (c) the independent Directors of the Fund determine that it
is not in the best interest of the Fund to purchase Interests pursuant to the
Offer. However, there can be no assurance that the Fund will exercise its right
to extend, amend or cancel the Offer or to postpone acceptance of tenders
pursuant to the Offer. If conditions qualifying as war or armed hostilities as
expressed in Section 7(b)(v) above occur (and, at present, the Fund does not
believe these conditions exist), and the Directors waive the Fund's rights under
Section 7, they will determine whether such waiver constitutes a material change
to the Offer. If they determine that it does, the Offer will remain open for at
least five business days following the waiver and investors will be notified of
this occurrence. </FONT></P>

non-diversified, management investment company and is organized as a Delaware
limited liability company. The principal executive office of the Fund is located
at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019 and the telephone

L.L.C. Agreement. The Fund's Directors are Meyer Feldberg, George W. Gowen and
Stephen H. Penman. Their address is c/o UBS Financial Services Inc., attention:
Alternative Investment Group, at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York
10019.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund does not have any
plans or proposals that relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any
person of additional Interests (other than the Fund's intention to accept
subscriptions for Interests from time to time in the discretion of the Fund) or
the disposition of Interests, other than as disclosed in the Prospectus; (b) an
extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation,
involving the Fund; (c) any material change in the present distribution policy
or indebtedness or capitalization of the Fund; (d) any change in the identity of
the Adviser or Directors of the Fund, or in the management of the Fund
including, but not limited to, any plans or proposals to change the number or
the term of the Directors of the Fund, to fill any existing vacancy for a
Director of the Fund or to change any material term of the investment advisory
arrangements with the Adviser, except that: (1) effective July 19, 2005, Richard
Sipes resigned as the principal executive officer of the Fund in connection with
his retirement and thereby ceased to be employed as an executive vice president
of UBS Financial Services, an affiliate of the Adviser; (2) effective July 19,
2005, Douglas A. Lindgren, a managing director of UBS Financial Services, was
appointed as the principal executive officer of the Fund; and (3) effective July
19, 2005, Frank Pluchino, the assistant director of compliance of UBS Financial
Services, was appointed as the chief compliance officer of the Fund; (e) a sale
or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Fund (other than as the
Directors determine may be necessary or appropriate to fund any portion of the
purchase price for Interests acquired pursuant to this Offer to Purchase or in
connection with the ordinary portfolio transactions of the Fund); (f) any other
material change in the Fund's structure or business, including any plans or
proposals to make any changes in its fundamental investment policy for which a
vote would be required by Section&#160;13 of the 1940 Act; or (g) any changes in
the L.L.C. Agreement or other actions that may impede the acquisition of control
of the Fund by any person. The Fund believes that the aforementioned departure
of Mr. Sipes will have no adverse effect on its operations. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Certain Federal Income Tax
Consequences.</B> The following discussion is a general summary of the federal
income tax consequences of the purchase of Interests by the Fund from investors
pursuant to the Offer. Investors should consult their own tax advisers for a
complete description of the tax consequences to them of a purchase of their
Interests by the Fund pursuant to the Offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An investor who tenders its
entire Interest (and whose entire interest is accepted) to the Fund for
repurchase generally will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the
difference between the proceeds received by such investor (consisting of the 90%
Cash Payment and the principal payment under the Note) and such investor's
adjusted tax basis in its Interest. Gain, if any, will be recognized by a
tendering investor only as and after the total proceeds received by such
investor exceed the investor's adjusted tax basis in its Interest. A loss, if
any, may be recognized after the tendering investor has received payment under
the Note. This capital gain or loss will be short-term or long-term depending
upon the investor's holding period for its Interest at the time the gain or loss
is recognized. Treasury Regulations provide that an investor will have a divided
(that is, fragmented) holding period for its interest if the investor makes
contributions to the Fund at different times. Under the Treasury Regulations,
each time the investor makes a contribution to the Fund, the investor will have
a new holding period for that portion of its Interest determined by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the amount of the contribution and the denominator of
which is the investor's capital account immediately after the contribution.
Certain cash contributions, if made within one year of a liquidating
distribution, can be netted against the distribution. If the investor recognizes
capital gain or loss in connection with a complete withdrawal from the Fund, the
gain or loss is divided between long-term and short-term capital gain or loss in
the same proportions as the holding period of the Interest is divided between
the portion of the Interest held for more than one year and the portion of the
Interest held for one year or less. Interest on the Notes is taxable to a
tendering investor receiving such Notes under such investor's method of
accounting, subject to the possible application of certain rules under the
Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations relating to short-term
obligations. A tendering investor will recognize ordinary income to the extent
such investor's allocable share of the Fund's &quot;unrealized receivables&quot;
exceeds the investor's basis in such unrealized receivables, as determined
pursuant to the Treasury Regulations. For these purposes, accrued but untaxed
market discount if any, on securities held by the Fund will be treated as an
unrealized receivable with respect to the tendering investor. An investor who
tenders less than its entire Interest to the Fund for repurchase will recognize
gain (but not loss) in a similar manner only to the extent that the amount of
the proceeds received (consisting of the 100% Cash Payment) exceeds such
investor's adjusted tax basis in its Interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an investor recognizes a
loss in an amount greater than $250,000 upon the tender of its entire Interest
to the Fund for repurchase, the Fund will be required, under Section 734 of the
Internal Revenue Code, to reduce the tax basis of its property by the amount of
the loss recognized by the tendering investor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the authority
granted to it under the L.L.C. Agreement, the Adviser intends to specially
allocate items of Fund capital gain, including short-term capital gain, to a
withdrawing investor to the extent its liquidating distribution would otherwise
exceed its adjusted tax basis in its Interest. Such a special allocation may
result in the withdrawing investor recognizing capital gain, which may include
short-term gain, in the investor's last taxable year in the Fund, thereby
potentially reducing the amount of any long-term capital gain that, absent the
special allocation, would otherwise have been recognized during the tax year in
which it receives its liquidating distribution upon withdrawal. Similarly, the
Adviser may specially allocate items of Fund capital loss to a withdrawing
investor to the extent its adjusted tax basis in its Interest would otherwise
exceed its liquidating distribution. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Treasury Regulations.</B> Treasury Regulations require taxpayers that
participate in "reportable transactions" to disclose such participation to the
Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") (by attaching Form 8886 to their tax
returns and filing a copy of that Form with the IRS Office of Tax Shelter
Analysis) and comply with certain document retention requirements. In addition,
certain organizers and sellers of such a transaction are required to maintain
records, including lists identifying investors in the transaction, and must
furnish those records to the Service upon demand. A transaction may be a
"reportable transaction" based on any of several criteria, one or more of which
may be present with respect to an investment in or by the Fund or the tender of
Interests. These regulations are directed towards "tax shelters," however, they
are quite broad and may encompass transactions that typically would not be
considered "tax shelters." Investors should consult their own tax advisors
concerning any possible disclosure obligation they may have with respect to
their investment in the Fund and any tender of Interests and should be aware
that the Fund (and perhaps other participants in the transaction) intends to
comply with the disclosure and investor list maintenance requirements to the
extent the Fund determines them to apply with respect to this transaction and/or
its investments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other
provision or statement in any offering document of the Fund (including the
Prospectus and the L.L.C. Agreement), an investor (and each employee,
representative or other agent of the Investor) may disclose to any and all
persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of
the Fund and the offering of its interests, this offer and all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the
investor relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. For the avoidance of
doubt, this authorization is not intended to permit disclosure of the names of,
or other identifying information regarding, the participants in the transaction,
or of any information or the portion of any materials not relevant to the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miscellaneous.</B> The Offer is
not being made to, nor will tenders be accepted from, investors in any
jurisdiction in which the Offer or its acceptance would not comply with the
securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdiction. The Fund is not aware of any
jurisdiction in which the Offer or tenders pursuant thereto would not be in
compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. However, the Fund reserves the
right to exclude investors from the Offer in any jurisdiction in which it is
asserted that the Offer cannot lawfully be made. The Fund believes such
exclusion is permissible under applicable laws and regulations, provided the
Fund makes a good faith effort to comply with any state law deemed applicable to
the Offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund has filed an
Issuer Tender Offer Statement on Schedule&#160;TO with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which includes certain information relating to the Offer
summarized herein. A free copy of such statement may be obtained from the Fund
by contacting PFPC at the address and phone number set forth on page 2 or from
the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet web site, http://www.sec.gov.
For a fee, a copy may be obtained from the public reference office of the
Securities and Exchange Commission at Judiciary Plaza, 450 Fifth Street, N.W.,

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Ladies and Gentlemen:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The undersigned hereby
tenders to UBS Multi-Strat Fund, L.L.C., a closed-end, non-diversified,
management investment company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
(the &quot;Fund&quot;), the limited liability company interest in the Fund or
portion thereof held by the undersigned, described and specified below, on the
terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated November 22, 2005
(&quot;Offer to Purchase&quot;), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and in
this Letter of Transmittal (which together constituted the &quot;Offer&quot;).
<B>The tender and this Letter of Transmittal are subject to all the terms and
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including, but not limited to,
the absolute right of the Fund to reject any and all tenders determined by it,
in its sole discretion, not to be in the appropriate form.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The undersigned hereby
sells to the Fund the limited liability company interest in the Fund or portion
thereof tendered hereby pursuant to the Offer. The undersigned hereby warrants
that the undersigned has full authority to sell the limited liability company
interest in the Fund or portion thereof tendered hereby and that the Fund will
acquire good title thereto, free and clear of all liens, charges, encumbrances,
conditional sales agreements or other obligations relating to the sale thereof,
and not subject to any adverse claim, when and to the extent the same are
purchased by it. Upon request, the undersigned will execute and deliver any
additional documents necessary to complete the sale in accordance with the terms
of the Offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The undersigned recognizes
that under certain circumstances set forth in the Offer, the Fund may not be
required to purchase any of the limited liability company interest in the Fund
or portions thereof tendered hereby. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>The undersigned
acknowledges that the method of delivery of any documents is at the election and
the complete risk of the undersigned, including, but not limited to, the failure
of the Fund's Administrator, PFPC Inc. (&quot;PFPC&quot;), to receive any Letter
of Transmittal or other document. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities
in connection with tenders must be cured within such time as the Fund shall
determine. Tenders will not be deemed to have been made until the defects or
irregularities have been cured or waived.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Payment of the cash portion
of the purchase price for the limited liability company interest in the Fund or
portion thereof of the undersigned (the &quot;Cash Payment&quot;), as described
in Section 6 of the Offer to Purchase, shall be sent to the undersigned by wire
transfer to the&#160;undersigned's brokerage account at UBS Financial Services
Inc. (&quot;UBS Financial Services&quot;) if such investor has a UBS Financial
Services account. (The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the
undersigned understands that, for cash payments wired directly to an investor's
brokerage account, upon a withdrawal of such cash payment from such account, UBS
Financial Services will impose such fees as it would customarily assess upon the
withdrawal of cash from such brokerage account.) If such investor does not have
a UBS Financial Services account, the Cash Payment will be sent directly to its
mailing address as listed in the Fund's records. A promissory note
(&quot;Note&quot;) reflecting the contingent payment portion of the purchase
price, if any, as described in Section 6 of the Offer to Purchase, will be held
for such investor by PFPC. (Any contingent payment due pursuant to the Note will
be deposited directly to the tendering investor's brokerage account at UBS
Financial Services if such investor has a UBS Financial Services account, and,
upon a withdrawal of such contingent payment from such account, UBS Financial
Services will impose such fees as it would customarily assess upon the
withdrawal of cash from such brokerage account.) The undersigned recognizes that
the amount of the Cash Payment will be based on the unaudited estimated net
asset value as of December 31, 2005, of the limited liability company interest
or portion thereof tendered, and that the contingent payment portion of the
purchase price, if any, will be determined upon completion of the audit of the
Fund's financial statements for calendar year 2005, which is anticipated to be
completed not later than 60 days after the Fund's fiscal year end, and will be
paid in cash within approximately ten days thereafter, or on such earlier date
as the Fund's Directors may determine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>All authority herein
conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the death or incapacity of the
undersigned and the obligation of the undersigned hereunder shall be binding on
the heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the undersigned.

<P><FONT SIZE=3>UBS Multi-Strat Fund, L.L.C.
(the &quot;Fund&quot;) has received and accepted your tender request. Enclosed
is a statement showing the breakdown of your capital withdrawal and the manner
in which it is being distributed, in accordance with the tender offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Since you have tendered
your entire investment, you have been paid 90% of the amount requested, in
accordance with the terms of the tender offer. The funds were wired directly
into your UBS Financial Services brokerage account if you have a UBS Financial
Services account. If you do not have a UBS Financial Services account, the funds
were mailed directly in the form of a check to you at your mailing address as
listed in the Fund's records. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The remaining 10% of the
amount requested is a contingent portion of the repurchased interest and is
valued based on the unaudited estimated net asset value of the Fund as of
December 31, 2005, and is subject to year-end audit adjustments which may cause
a change in the value of the contingent portion of the repurchased interest. The
contingent portion, together with interest, will be paid (subject to audit
adjustment) within approximately ten days after the conclusion of the 2005
year-end audit, or on such earlier date as the Fund's Directors may determine,
according to the terms of the tender offer. We expect the audit to be completed
by the end of February 2006. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Gentlemen:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The undersigned, UBS PW EQUITY OPPORTUNITY FUND, LIMITED, an exempted company
incorporated under the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision), as amended, of the
Cayman Islands ("Cayman Equity Opportunity Fund"), PW TECHNOLOGY FUND, LTD., an
exempted company incorporated under the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision), as

Fund, PW Technology Fund, Equity Opportunity Fund II, Equity Opportunity Fund,
Health Sciences Fund, Recovery Fund, Event &amp; Equity Fund, Technology Partners,
UBS M2 Fund and Masters Fund, individually a "Borrower" and collectively the
"Borrowers"), apply to you for your commitment, subject to all of the terms and
conditions hereof and on the basis of the representations and warranties
hereinafter set forth, to make a revolving credit (the "Revolving Credit")
available to the Borrowers, all as more fully set forth herein.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>SECTION 1. THE CREDIT FACILITIES.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 1.1.Revolving Credit Commitment.</I> Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Lender agrees to extend a Revolving Credit to each
Borrower which may be availed of by each Borrower from time to time during the
period from and including the date hereof to but not including the Termination
Date (the "Commitment Period"), at which time the commitment of the Lender to
extend credit under the Revolving Credit shall expire. The maximum amount of the
Revolving Credit which the Lender agrees to extend to the Borrowers shall be the
Lender's Commitment as then in effect. The Revolving Credit may be utilized by
the Borrowers in the form of Loans, all as more fully hereinafter set forth,
provided, that, the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding at any one
time shall not exceed the Commitment and the maximum aggregate amount of all
Loans made to any Borrower at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the
lesser of (a) the Commitment, and (b) such Borrower's Borrowing Limit. During
the Commitment Period, each Borrower may utilize the Revolving Credit by
borrowing, repaying and reborrowing Loans in whole or in part, all in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Loans shall be made available
to the Borrowers on a first come, first served basis, provided, that, if the
amount of Loans which some or all Borrowers would otherwise request on the same
Business Day would exceed the Available Commitment, the Available Commitment
will be apportioned among the Borrowers in accordance with resolutions adopted
by the boards of directors of the Borrowers and the results of such
apportionment will be reported in writing to the Lender by the Adviser.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 1.2. The Loans.</I> (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
the Revolving Credit may be availed of by each of the Borrowers in the form of
loans (individually a "Loan" and collectively the "Loans"). Each Loan shall be
in a minimum amount of $250,000 or any greater amount that is an integral
multiple of $50,000. Each Loan shall mature on the Termination Date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) Each Borrower hereby severally and unconditionally, but not jointly or
jointly and severally, promises to pay to the Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Loan made by the Lender to such Borrower on the Termination Date
(or such earlier date on which the Loans become due and payable pursuant to this
Agreement). Each Borrower hereby further severally, but not jointly or jointly
and severally, agrees to pay to the Lender interest on the unpaid principal
amount of the Loans made to such Borrower from time to time outstanding from the
date hereof until payment in full thereof at the rates per annum, and on the
dates, set forth in Section 1.4.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) The Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account
or accounts evidencing Loans made to each Borrower by the Lender from time to
time, including (i) the amounts of principal and interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from each Borrower to the Lender hereunder, and (ii) the
amount of any sum received by the Lender from each Borrower. The entries made in
the accounts of the Lender maintained pursuant to this Section 1.2(c) shall,
other than in the case of manifest error, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, be <I>prima facie</I> evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of
each of the Borrowers therein recorded, <I>provided, however,</I> that the failure of
the Lender to maintain any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any
manner affect the obligation of any Borrower to repay (with applicable interest)
the Loans made to such Borrower by the Lender in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d) Each Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Lender a promissory note
evidencing the Loans of the Lender to such Borrower, substantially in the form
of Exhibit A with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount
(individually a <I>"Note"</I> and collectively the <I>"Notes")</I>. Without regard to the
principal amount of any Note stated on its face, the actual principal amount at
any time outstanding and owing by the Borrower on account of a Note shall be the
sum of all Loans made to such Borrower hereunder less all payments of principal
actually received by the Lender with respect to such Loans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 1.3. Manner of Borrowing.</I> (a) <I>Notice to Lender.</I> A Borrower
shall give the Lender written notice with respect to any borrowing it intends to
make under the Revolving Credit, and each such notice shall include the date of
such borrowing and the principal amount thereof. Each such notice shall be in
the form of Schedule 1.3(a) attached hereto and shall be given on a Business Day
and must be received by the Lender prior to 3:00 p.m. Chicago time on the date
any requested Loan is to be made. The proceeds of each Loan shall be made
available to the Borrower requesting such Loan by being deposited in that
Borrower's account with the Lender or to such other account as such Borrower may
direct in writing at the time a Loan is requested as provided in this Section
1.3; provided, however, that if prior to the time the Lender has disbursed the
proceeds of such Loan an Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Lender shall not be required to disburse
such Loan. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the
Lender may rely solely upon a written request it reasonably believes is made on
behalf of an authorized representative of the relevant Borrower in making Loans
hereunder. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold the Lender harmless for
any commercially reasonable action taken, including, without limitation, the
making of Loans to such Borrower hereunder, or loss or expense incurred, by the
Lender in good faith reliance upon such written request it reasonably believes
is made by an authorized representative of such Borrower for a Loan; provided
that such Borrower shall not be liable for any such action, loss or expense to
the extent the same shall result directly from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Lender.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) <I>Disbursement of Loans.</I> Not later than 4:00 p.m. Chicago time on the
date of any requested advance of a borrowing, subject to Section 6 hereof, the
Lender shall make available borrowing in funds immediately available at the
principal office of the Lender in Chicago, Illinois or to such other account as
the applicable Borrower may request in writing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 1.4. Applicable Interest Rates.</I> (a) All Loans hereunder shall
bear interest (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days
elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date such Loan is made
until maturity (whether by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise) at a rate
per annum equal to the sum of one and one-half of one percent (1.5%) plus the
Fed Funds Rate from time to time in effect. Interest on the Loans shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and
December in each year (commencing on the first such date occurring after the
date hereof) and at maturity of the Notes, and interest accrued or outstanding
after maturity of the Notes (whether by lapse of time, acceleration, or
otherwise) shall be due and payable upon demand. Any change in the interest rate
on the Loans resulting from a change in the Fed Funds Rate shall be effective on
the date of the relevant change in the Fed Funds Rate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) If any payment of principal on any Loan is not made when due, such unpaid
amount shall bear interest (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
actual days elapsed) from the date such payment was due until paid in full,
payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of three and one-half of
one percent (3.5%) plus the Fed Funds Rate from time to time in effect.</FONT></P>

<I>Section 1.5. Borrowers' Obligations Several.</I> (a) Notwithstanding anything in any
Loan Document to the contrary, each Borrower shall be liable for the repayment
of the principal of, and interest on, Loans made to such Borrower and no other
Borrower shall have any liability therefor. The parties hereto agree that with
respect to all other amounts payable to the Lender under the Loan Documents,
including, without limitation, commitment fees and reimbursement for legal
expenses, each Borrower shall be liable only for its Pro Rata Share (as defined
below) thereof. For purposes of this Agreement, <I>"Pro Rata Share"</I> shall mean,
with respect to any Borrower with respect to any amount required to be paid by
the Borrowers based on their Pro Rata Share thereof, that percentage determined
by dividing the fair market value of such Borrower's total assets by the sum of
the fair market value of all of the Borrowers' total assets, <I>provided</I> that the
Pro Rata Shares of all Borrowers shall at all times equal 100%.

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) The obligations of each Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be several and not joint. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the sole source of payment of the obligations of each Borrower hereunder,
including, without limitation, the principal of, and interest on, each Loan made
to any Borrower, the fees payable pursuant to Section 2.1 and any other amounts
payable hereunder shall be the revenues and assets of such Borrower, and not the
revenues and assets of any other Borrower or any of its Affiliates (other than
such Borrower).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 1.6. Withdrawal of Borrowers.</I> In the event any Borrower wishes to
cease being a party to this Agreement, such Borrower shall give the Lender at
least three Business Days' advance written notice thereof. On the date specified
in such notice and subject to the receipt by the Lender of the outstanding
principal balance of all Loans made to such Borrower which are then outstanding
together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and such Borrower's Pro
Rata Share of any accrued and unpaid fees and other amounts due hereunder, such
Borrower will cease to be a <I>"Borrower"</I> hereunder, <I>provided,
however,</I> that any obligations of such Borrower hereunder which would survive
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof shall survive
such Borrower's withdrawal from this Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>SECTION 2. FEES, PREPAYMENTS, REDUCTIONS, AND TERMINATIONS.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Section 2.1. Fees.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a) <I>Commitment Fees.</I> During the Commitment Period, the Borrowers shall
pay to the Lender a commitment fee in an amount equal to one-quarter of one
percent (0.25%) per annum of the average daily unused amount of the Commitment,
calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed. Accrued
fees payable hereunder shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each
March, June, September and December in each year, commencing on September 30,
2004, unless the Commitment is terminated in whole on an earlier date, in which
event the commitment fee for the final period shall be paid on a pro rated basis
on the date of such earlier termination in whole.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) <I>Closing Fee.</I> Each Borrower severally agrees to pay to the Lender its
Pro Rata Share of a closing fee in the amount of $37,500 payable on the date of
this Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 2.2. Optional Prepayments.</I> Any Borrower may prepay any Loan
without premium or penalty and in whole or in part (but if in part, then in a
principal amount of $300,000 or an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof) at any time upon prior written or telephonic notice prior to 3:00 p.m.
Chicago time to the Lender, by payment to the Lender of the principal amount
being prepaid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 2.3. Mandatory Prepayments--Asset Coverage.</I> No Borrower shall
permit the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Loans obtained by it
hereunder at any time to exceed the lesser of (a) the Commitment, and (b) such
Borrower's Borrowing Limit. Any Borrower exceeding the limits set forth in this
Section 2.3 will make prepayments on such Borrower's outstanding Loans which are
necessary to cure any such excess, together with accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, within three Business Days after the occurrence thereof.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 2.4. Termination By Borrowers.</I> The Borrowers shall have the
option at any time to terminate the Lender's Commitment only in whole upon 30
days written notice to the Lender. Upon such termination all amounts payable
hereunder and under the Notes will become due and payable on the effective date
of such termination without notice to the Borrowers, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in any Note.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>Section 2.5. Change in Capital Adequacy Requirements.</I> (a) If the Lender
shall reasonably determine that the adoption after the date hereof of any
applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change in
any existing law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof, by any governmental authority, central bank or
comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by the Lender (or any of its branches) with any request or directive
regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on the Lender's capital as a consequence of its
obligations hereunder or the credit which is the subject matter hereof to a
level below that which the Lender would have achieved before such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration the Lender's policies with
respect to liquidity and capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by the Lender to
be material, then from time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by
the Lender, each Borrower severally shall pay to the Lender such Borrower's Pro
Rata Share of such additional amount or amounts reasonably determined by the
Lender as will compensate the Lender for such reduction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) If the Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amount or amounts
pursuant to this Section, it shall promptly notify each of the Borrowers of the
event by reason of which it has become so entitled and setting out its reasons
why it believes an increased payment by each of the Borrowers is due. A
certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section
submitted by the Lender to any of the Borrowers shall be prima facie evidence of
the information recorded therein and shall set forth in reasonable detail the
amount and the computation thereof that is due. The agreements in this Section
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and
all other amounts payable hereunder. The Borrowers shall have no obligation to
compensate the Lender for any cost or reduction incurred by it more than one
year before the Lender gives notice of the event giving rise to such cost or
reduction.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>SECTION 3. PLACE AND APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All payments of principal, interest, fees and all other amounts payable
hereunder made by the Borrowers shall be made to the Lender at its office at 111
West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603 (or at such other place as the
Lender may specify), and in funds there current, for the benefit of the Lender
and any other holder of any Note no later than 3:00 p.m. Chicago time on the
date such payment is due or as the Lender may otherwise direct. All such
payments shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America, in
immediately available funds at the place of payment, without setoff or
counterclaim and without reduction for, and free from, any and all present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, charges, deductions, withholdings,
restrictions or conditions of any nature imposed by any government or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof (but excluding any taxes
imposed on or measured by the net income of the Lender). Any payments received
after 3:00 p.m. (or after the later time the Lender may otherwise direct) shall
be deemed received upon the following Business Day.</FONT></P>

<I>Section 5.1. Organization and Qualification.</I> Such Borrower is a limited
liability company duly organized and validly existing and in good standing as a
limited liability company under the laws of the state of its organization, or an
exempted company incorporated under the Companies Law (2001 Second Revision) of
the Cayman Islands in the case of a Cayman Borrower, has full and adequate power
to own its Property and conduct its business as now conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the nature of the Property owned or
leased by it requires such licensing or qualifying. Such Borrower has full right
and authority to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, to make
the borrowings herein provided for, to issue its Notes in evidence thereof, and
to perform each and all of the matters and things herein and therein provided
for; and this Agreement and the other Loan Documents do not, nor does the
performance or observance by such Borrower of any of the matters and things
herein or therein provided for, contravene or constitute a default under any
provision of law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon such
Borrower or any charter, declaration of trust or by-law provision of such
Borrower or any covenant, indenture or agreement of or affecting such Borrower
or any of its Properties, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on

<I>Section 5.4. Litigation and Other Controversies; Taxes; Approvals.</I> There
is no litigation or governmental proceeding or labor controversy pending, nor to
the knowledge of such Borrower threatened in writing, against such Borrower
which if adversely determined would result in any Material Adverse Effect with
respect to such Borrower. All income tax returns for such Borrower required to
be filed have been filed on a timely basis (including any extensions) and all
amounts required to be paid as shown by said returns have been paid, the failure
of which to file or pay when due or payable would have a Material Adverse Effect

assessments due in respect of the tax returns of such Borrower pending, nor to
the knowledge of such Borrower is any such objection, controversy or assessment
threatened in writing. Except as obtained, no authorization, consent, license,

PBGC. No condition exists nor has any event or transaction occurred with respect
to any Plan which could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence by
such Borrower of any material liability, fine or penalty under ERISA or in
connection with any Plan. Such Borrower does not have any contingent liabilities
for any post-retirement benefits under a Welfare Plan, other than liabilities
for continuation of coverage described in Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.</FONT></P>

Health Act of 1970, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990),
noncompliance with which would have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
such Borrower.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

upon execution and delivery, will constitute legal, valid and binding agreements
of such Borrower, enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws or judicial decisions for the relief of debtors or the limitation of

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Effect with respect to such Borrower.</FONT></P>

aggregate market value (determined in accordance with Regulation U) of direct
investments in Margin Stock owned by such Borrower will at all times equal or

Borrower. If requested by the Lender from time to time, such Borrower will
furnish to the Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the
requirements of Form U-1 referred to in Regulation U.</FONT></P>
