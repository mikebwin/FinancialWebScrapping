LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTERESTS AT NET ASSET VALUE<BR>
DATED FEBRUARY 27, 2004<BR>
<BR>
THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT<BR>

UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>To the Investors of<BR>
UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (formerly known as UBS PW M2 Fund, L.L.C.), a closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment company organized as a Delaware limited
liability company (the &quot;Fund&quot;), is offering to purchase for cash on
the terms and conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (&quot;Offer to
Purchase&quot;) and the related Letter of Transmittal (which together with the
Offer to Purchase constitutes the &quot;Offer&quot;) up to $125,000,000 in
interests in the Fund (the &quot;Interests&quot;) or portions thereof pursuant
to tenders by investors at a price equal to their estimated net asset value as
of March 31, 2004, if the Offer expires on March 26, 2004. If the Fund elects to
extend the tender period for any reason, for the purpose of determining the
purchase price for tendered Interests, the estimated net asset value of such
Interests will be determined at the close of business on the last business day
of the month in which the tender offer actually expires. (As used in this Offer,
the term &quot;Interest,&quot; or &quot;Interests,&quot; as the context
requires, shall refer to the interests in the Fund and portions thereof
representing beneficial interests in the Fund.) This Offer is being made to all
investors of the Fund and is not conditioned on any minimum amount of Interests
being tendered, but is subject to certain conditions described below. Interests
are not traded on any established trading market and are subject to strict
restrictions on transferability pursuant to the Fund's Limited Liability Company
Agreement dated as of September 10, 2002 (the &quot;L.L.C. Agreement&quot;).
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investors should realize that the value of the Interests tendered in this Offer
likely will change between January 31, 2004 (the last time estimated net asset
value was calculated) and February 29, 2004 (the next time estimated net asset
value will be calculated) and March 31, 2004, when the value of the Interests
tendered to the Fund will be determined for purposes of calculating the purchase
price of such Interests. Investors should also note that although the tender
offer expires on March 26, 2004, they remain investors in the Fund until March
31, 2004, when the estimated net asset value of their Interests is calculated.
The Fund determines the estimated net asset value at least monthly and may
determine the estimated net asset value more frequently. Any tendering investors
that wish to obtain the most current estimated net asset value of their
Interests on this basis should contact the Fund's Administrator, PFPC Inc.
(&quot;PFPC&quot;), at the telephone number or address set forth below, Monday
through Friday, except holidays, during normal business hours of 9:00 a.m. to
5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investors desiring to tender all or any portion of their Interest in the Fund in
accordance with the terms of the Offer should complete and sign the attached
Letter of Transmittal (the last page will suffice) and mail or fax it to the
Fund in the manner set forth below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Neither the Fund, the Adviser, any affiliate of the Adviser, nor any of the
Directors makes any recommendation to any investor as to whether to tender or
refrain from tendering Interests. Investors must make their own decisions
whether to tender Interests, and, if so, the portion of their Interests to
tender.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Because each investor's investment decision is a personal one, based on its
financial circumstances, no person has been authorized to make any
recommendation on behalf of the Fund as to whether investors should tender
Interests pursuant to the Offer. No person has been authorized to give any
information or to make any representations in connection with the Offer other
than those contained herein or in the Letter of Transmittal. If given or made,
such recommendation and such information and representations must not be relied
on as having been authorized by the Fund.</B> </FONT></P>

<B>This transaction has not been approved or disapproved by the Securities and
Exchange Commission nor has the Securities and Exchange Commission or any state

the accuracy or adequacy of the information contained in this document. Any

To make sure we have calculated net asset value correctly, we will check it
during the Fund's audit for calendar year 2004, which we expect will be
completed in February 2005. If you tender your entire interest in the Fund, we
will pay you in cash by approximately April 7, 2004, 90% of our calculation of
the estimated net asset value as of March 31, 2004. We will owe you the balance,
for which we will give you a promissory note that will be held for you by PFPC.
If you tender part of your interest, leaving a remainder at least equal to
$50,000 ($25,000 for certain eligible investors who are identified in the Fund's
Prospectus), we will pay all your proceeds in cash by approximately April 7th.
We will obtain the cash to pay you, either from cash on hand, selling portfolio
securities or through borrowings (which we do not intend to do).</TD>

Following this summary is a formal notice of our offer to purchase your
Interests. Our offer remains open to you until midnight on March 26, 2004. Until
this time, you have the right to change your mind and withdraw your Interests
from consideration for purchase. If we do not accept your interests by midnight,
March 26, 2004, you may still withdraw your Interests at any time after April
23, 2004, assuming your offer has not been accepted.</TD>

If you would like us to purchase your Interests, you should mail or fax a Letter
of Transmittal (the last page of the letter will suffice), enclosed with our
offer, to PFPC at the address/fax number listed on page 2 of this Offer to
Purchase, so that it is received before midnight, March 26, 2004. If you choose
to fax the Letter of Transmittal, you should mail the original last page of the
Letter of Transmittal to PFPC promptly after you fax it (although the original
page does not have to be received before midnight, March 26, 2004). Of course,
the estimated value of your Interests is likely to change between January 31,
2004 (the last time estimated net asset value was calculated), February 29, 2004
(the next time it will be calculated) and March 31, 2004, when the estimated
value of your investment will be determined for purposes of calculating your
purchase price. The net asset value of your Interests is determined at least
monthly and may be determined more frequently.</TD>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Background and Purpose of the Offer</B>. The
purpose of the Offer is to provide liquidity to investors who hold Interests as
contemplated by and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Fund's
Prospectus dated as of December 19, 2002, as supplemented (the "Prospectus"),
and the L.L.C. Agreement. The Prospectus as then in effect and the L.L.C.
Agreement, which were provided to each investor in advance of subscribing for
Interests, provide that the Directors have the discretion to determine whether
the Fund will repurchase Interests from investors from time to time pursuant to
written tenders. The Prospectus also states that UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C., the
adviser of the Fund (the "Adviser"), expects that generally it will recommend to
the Directors that the Fund repurchase Interests from investors in March 2004
and December 2004 and, thereafter, twice each year, near mid-year and year-end.
Because there is no secondary trading market for Interests and transfers of
Interests are prohibited without prior approval of the Fund, the Directors have
determined, after consideration of various matters, including, but not limited
to, those set forth in the Prospectus, that the Offer is in the best interests
of investors of the Fund to provide liquidity for Interests as contemplated in
the Prospectus and the L.L.C. Agreement. The Directors intend to consider the
continued desirability of the Fund making an offer to purchase Interests in
December 2004 and twice each year thereafter (currently anticipated to be near
mid-year and year-end), but the Fund is not required to make any such
offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The purchase of Interests pursuant to the Offer will have the effect of
decreasing the size of the Fund and increasing the proportionate interest in the
Fund of investors who do not tender Interests. A reduction in the aggregate
assets of the Fund may result in investors who do not tender Interests bearing
higher costs to the extent that certain expenses borne by the Fund are
relatively fixed and may not decrease if assets decline. These effects may be
reduced or eliminated to the extent that additional subscriptions for Interests
are made from time to time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Interests that are tendered to the Fund in connection with this Offer will be
retired, although the Fund may issue new Interests from time to time.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Offer to Purchase and Price</B>. The Fund
will purchase, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, up to
$125,000,000 of those outstanding Interests that are properly tendered by and
not withdrawn (in accordance with Section 5 below) before 12:00 midnight, New
York time, on March 26, 2004 (such time and date being hereinafter called the
"Initial Expiration Date"). If the Fund elects to extend the tender period for
any reason, for the purpose of determining the purchase price for tendered
Interests, the estimated net asset value of such Interests will be determined at
the close of business on the last business day of the month in which the tender
offer actually expires. The later of the Initial Expiration Date or the latest
time and date to which the Offer is extended hereinafter is called the
"Expiration Date." The Fund reserves the right to extend, amend or cancel the
Offer as described in Sections 3 and 7 below. The purchase price of an Interest
tendered will be its estimated net asset value as of the close of business on
the last day of the month in which the Expiration Date occurs, payable as set
forth in Section 6. The table below shows the estimated unaudited net asset
value, as of February 1, 2004, of an initial capital contribution of $125,000
made as of the dates on which initial investments in the Fund were
accepted:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As of the close of business on February 1, 2004, there were approximately
$307,836,276 outstanding in capital of the Fund held in Interests (based on the
unaudited estimated net asset value of such Interests). The Fund determines its
estimated net asset value at least monthly and may determine its estimated net
asset value more frequently. Investors may obtain the most current information
regarding the estimated net asset value of their Interests by contacting PFPC,
at the telephone number or address set forth on page 2, Monday through Friday,
except holidays, during normal business hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern
Time). Of course, the estimated value of the Interests tendered by the investors
likely will change between January 31, 2004 (the last time estimated net asset
value was calculated) and February 29, 2004 (the next time it will be
calculated) and March 31, 2004, when the value of the Interests tendered by
investors will be determined for purposes of calculating the purchase price of
such Interests and the time that investors will cease to be investors in the
Fund. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Amount of Tender</B>. Subject to the
limitations set forth below, investors may tender their entire Interest or a
portion of their Interest. However, an investor who tenders for repurchase only
a portion of such investor's Interest shall be required to maintain a capital
account balance equal to $50,000 ($25,000 for certain eligible investors who are
identified in the Fund's Prospectus). If an investor tenders an amount that
would cause the investor's capital account balance to fall below the required
minimum, the Fund reserves the right to reduce the amount to be purchased from
such investor so that the required minimum balance is maintained. The Offer is
being made to all investors of the Fund and is not conditioned on any minimum
amount of Interests being tendered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the amount of the Interests that are properly tendered pursuant to the Offer
and not withdrawn pursuant to Section 5 below is less than or equal to
$125,000,000 (or such greater amount as the Fund may elect to purchase pursuant
to the Offer), the Fund will, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer, purchase all of the Interests so tendered unless the Fund elects to
cancel or amend the Offer, or postpone acceptance of tenders made pursuant to
the Offer, as provided in Section 7 below. If more than $125,000,000 in
Interests are duly tendered to the Fund before the expiration of the Offer and
not withdrawn pursuant to Section 5 below, the Fund will, in its sole
discretion, either (a) accept the additional Interests permitted to be accepted
pursuant to Rule 13e-4(f)(1)(ii) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended; (b) extend the Offer, if necessary, and increase the amount of
Interests that the Fund is offering to purchase to an amount it believes
sufficient to accommodate the excess Interests tendered as well as any Interests
tendered during the extended Offer; or (c) accept Interests tendered on or
before the Expiration Date for payment on a pro rata basis based on the
aggregate estimated net asset value of tendered Interests. The Offer may be
extended, amended or canceled in various other circumstances described in
Section 7 below. The Adviser beneficially owns $1,105,561 in Interests and
intends to tender substantially all of its Interests in the Offer, except for
approximately $15,000 in Interests. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Procedure for Tenders</B>. Investors wishing
to tender Interests pursuant to the Offer should mail a completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal (the last page will suffice) to PFPC, to the attention of
Tender Offer Administrator, at the address set forth on page 2, or fax a
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to PFPC, also to the attention of
Tender Offer Administrator, at the fax numbers set forth on page 2. The
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal must be received by PFPC, either by
mail or by fax, no later than the Expiration Date. The Fund recommends that all
documents be submitted to PFPC by certified mail, return receipt requested, or
by facsimile transmission. An investor choosing to fax a Letter of Transmittal
to PFPC must also mail the original completed and executed Letter of Transmittal
(the last page will suffice) to PFPC promptly thereafter. If an investor elects
to tender, it is the tendering investor's responsibility to confirm receipt of
the Letter of Transmittal or other document with PFPC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investors wishing to confirm receipt of a Letter of Transmittal may contact PFPC
at the address and phone number set forth on page 2. The&#160;method of delivery
of any documents is at the election and complete risk of the investor tendering
an Interest, including, but not limited to, the failure of PFPC to receive any
Letter of Transmittal or other document. All questions as to the validity, form,
eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of tenders will be
determined by the Fund, in its sole discretion, and such determination shall be
final and binding. The Fund reserves the absolute right to reject any or all
tenders determined by it not to be in appropriate form or the acceptance of or
payment for which would, in the opinion of counsel for the Fund, be unlawful.
The Fund also reserves the absolute right to waive any of the conditions of the
Offer or any defect in any tender with respect to any particular Interest or any
particular investor, and the Fund's interpretation of the terms and conditions
of the Offer will be final and binding. Unless waived, any defects or
irregularities in connection with tenders must be cured within such time as the
Fund shall determine. Tenders will not be deemed to have been made until the
defects or irregularities have been cured or waived. Neither the Fund nor the
Adviser nor Directors of the Fund shall be obligated to give notice of any
defects or irregularities in tenders, nor shall any of them incur any liability
for failure to give such notice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Withdrawal Rights</B>. Any investor
tendering an Interest pursuant to this Offer may withdraw its tender at any time
on or before the Expiration Date and, if Interests have not then been accepted
by the Fund, at any time after April 23, 2004. To be effective, any notice of
withdrawal must be timely received by PFPC at the address or fax numbers set
forth on page 2. A form to use to give notice of withdrawal is available by
calling PFPC at the phone number indicated on page 2. All questions as to the
form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be
determined by the Fund, in its sole discretion, and such determination shall be
final and binding. Interests properly withdrawn shall not thereafter be deemed
to be tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Interests may be
tendered prior to the Expiration Date by following the procedures described in
Section 4.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Purchases and Payment</B>. For purposes of
the Offer, the Fund will be deemed to have accepted (and thereby purchased)
Interests that are tendered as, if and when it gives oral or written notice to
the tendering investor of its election to purchase such Interest. As stated in
Section 2 above, the purchase price of an Interest tendered by any investor will
be the estimated net asset value thereof as of the close of business on March
31, 2004, if the Offer expires on the Initial Expiration Date. If the Fund
elects to extend the tender period for any reason, for the purpose of
determining the purchase price for tendered Interests, the estimated net asset
value of such Interests will be determined at the close of business on the last
business day of the month in which the tender offer actually expires. The Fund
will determine estimated net asset value after it makes the allocations required
by the L.L.C. Agreement to the capital accounts of investors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For investors who tender their entire Interest, payment of the purchase price
will consist of: (1) cash in an aggregate amount equal to 90% of the estimated
unaudited net asset value of Interests tendered by the investor and accepted by
the Fund, determined as of March 31, 2004, payable by approximately April 7,
2004 (the &quot;90% Cash Payment&quot;) and (2)&#160;a promissory note (the
&quot;Note&quot;), entitling the holder thereof to a contingent payment equal to
the excess, if any, of (a) the net asset value of the Interests tendered by the
investor and accepted by the Fund as of the Expiration Date, determined as of
March 31, 2004, based on the audited financial statements of the Fund for
calendar year 2004, over (b) the 90% Cash Payment. The Note will be held for
each tendering investor by PFPC as set forth below, will be prepared within
approximately ten days after the Fund's estimated net asset value is calculated
and will not be transferable. The Note will be payable in cash (in the manner
set forth below) within approximately ten days after completion of the audit of
the financial statements of the Fund for calendar year 2004, or on such earlier
date as the Fund's Directors may determine. It is anticipated that the audit of
the Fund's financial statements for calendar year 2004 will be completed by no
later than 60 days after the end of the year. Any amounts payable under the Note
will include interest, if any, earned by the Fund on an amount, deposited by the
Fund in a segregated custodial account, equal to 10% of the estimated unaudited
net asset value of Interests tendered by the investor and accepted by the Fund.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investors who tender a portion of their Interests (subject to maintenance of a
minimum capital account balance) will receive cash in an aggregate amount equal
to 100% of the estimated unaudited net asset value of Interests tendered by the
investor and accepted by the Fund, determined as of March 31, 2004, payable by
approximately April 7, 2004 (the &quot;100% Cash Payment&quot;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Both the 90% Cash Payment and the 100% Cash Payment (together, the &quot;Cash
Payment&quot;) will be made by wire transfer directly to the tendering
investor's brokerage account with UBS Financial Services Inc., formerly known as
UBS PaineWebber Inc. (&quot;UBS Financial Services&quot;), if such investor has
a UBS Financial Services account. Cash Payments wired directly to brokerage
accounts will be subject upon withdrawal from such accounts to any fees that UBS
Financial Services would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from
such brokerage account. If such investor does not have a UBS Financial Services
account, the Cash Payment will be sent directly to its mailing address as listed
in the Fund's records, unless such investor advises the Fund in writing of a
change in its mailing address. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Note will be held for each investor by PFPC. Any contingent payment due
pursuant to the Note will be deposited directly to the tendering investor's
brokerage account at UBS Financial Services if such investor has a UBS Financial
Services account, and will be subject upon withdrawal from such account to any
fees that UBS Financial Services would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of
cash from such brokerage account. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Fund expects that the purchase price for Interests acquired pursuant to the
Offer to Purchase, which will not exceed $125,000,000 (unless the Fund elects,
in its sole and absolute discretion, to purchase a greater amount), will be
derived from: (1) cash on hand; (2) the proceeds of the sale of and/or delivery
of securities and portfolio assets held by the Fund; and/or (3) possibly
borrowings, as described below. The Fund will segregate, with its custodian,
cash or U.S. government securities or other liquid securities equal to the value
of the amount estimated to be paid under any Notes as described above. Neither
the Fund nor the Adviser nor Directors have determined at this time to borrow
funds to purchase Interests in connection with the Offer to Purchase. However,
depending on the dollar amount of Interests tendered and prevailing general
economic and market conditions, the Fund, in its sole discretion, may decide to
seek to borrow money to fund all or a portion of the purchase price. No
borrowing facilities have been entered into to date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Certain Conditions of the Offer</B>. The
Fund reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, to extend the period
of time during which the Offer is pending by notifying investors of such
extension. If the Fund elects to extend the tender period for any reason, for
the purpose of determining the purchase price for tendered Interests, the
estimated net asset value of such Interests will be determined at the close of
business on the last business day of the month in which the tender offer
actually expires. During any such extension, all Interests previously tendered
and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer. The Fund also reserves the
right, at any time and from time to time, up to and including acceptance of
tenders pursuant to the Offer, to: (a) cancel the Offer in the circumstances set
forth in the following paragraph and in the event of such cancellation, not to
purchase or pay for any Interests tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b) amend the
Offer; or (c) postpone the acceptance of Interests. If the Fund determines to
amend the Offer or to postpone the acceptance of Interests tendered, it will, to
the extent necessary, extend the period of time during which the Offer is open
as provided above and will promptly notify investors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Fund may cancel the Offer, amend the Offer or postpone the acceptance of
tenders made pursuant to the Offer if: (a) the Fund would not be able to
liquidate portfolio securities in a manner that is orderly and consistent with
the Fund's investment objectives and policies in order to purchase Interests
tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b) there is, in the Directors' judgment, any
(i) legal action or proceeding instituted or threatened challenging the Offer or
that otherwise would have a material adverse affect on the Fund, (ii)
declaration of a banking moratorium by Federal or state authorities or any
suspension of payment by banks in the United States or New York State that is
material to the Fund, (iii) limitation imposed by Federal or state authorities
on the extension of credit by lending institutions, (iv) suspension of trading
on any organized exchange or over-the-counter market where the Fund has a
material investment, (v) commencement of war, armed hostilities or other
international or national calamity directly or indirectly involving the United
States that is material to the Fund, (vi) material decrease in the estimated net
asset value of the Fund from the estimated net asset value of the Fund as of the
commencement of the Offer, or (vii)&#160;other event or condition that would
have a material adverse effect on the Fund or its investors if Interests
tendered pursuant to the Offer were purchased; or (c) the independent Directors
of the Fund determine that it is not in the best interest of the Fund to
purchase Interests pursuant to the Offer. However, there can be no assurance
that the Fund will exercise its right to extend, amend or cancel the Offer or to
postpone acceptance of tenders pursuant to the Offer. If conditions qualifying
as war or armed hostilities as expressed in Section 7(b)(v) above occur (and, at
present, the Fund does not believe these conditions exist), and the Directors
waive the Fund's rights under Section 7, they will determine whether such waiver
constitutes a material change to the Offer. If they determine that it does, the
Offer will remain open for at least five business days following the waiver and
investors will be notified of this occurrence. </FONT></P>

The Fund does not have any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in:
(a) the acquisition by any person of additional Interests (other than the Fund's
intention to accept subscriptions for Interests from time to time in the
discretion of the Fund) or the disposition of Interests, other than as disclosed
in the Prospectus; (b) an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger,
reorganization or liquidation, involving the Fund; (c) any material change in
the present distribution policy or indebtedness or capitalization of the Fund;
(d) any change in the identity of the Adviser or Directors of the Fund, or in
the management of the Fund including, but not limited to, any plans or proposals
to change the number or the term of the Directors of the Fund, to fill any
existing vacancy for a Director of the Fund or to change any material term of
the investment advisory arrangements with the Adviser, except that M. Cabell
Woodward, Jr. has advised the Fund of his intention to retire as a Director some
time during 2004; the Fund's &quot;disinterested directors&quot; (as such term
is defined in the 1940 Act), acting as a nominating committee, will seek to
nominate a replacement to fill Mr. Woodward's vacancy as well as perhaps
nominate an additional Director to the Board who would be a representative of
the Adviser; (e) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Fund
(other than as the Directors determine may be necessary or appropriate to fund
any portion of the purchase price for Interests acquired pursuant to this Offer
to Purchase or in connection with the ordinary portfolio transactions of the
Fund); (f) any other material change in the Fund's structure or business,
including any plans or proposals to make any changes in its fundamental
investment policy for which a vote would be required by Section&#160;13 of the
1940 Act; or (g) any changes in the L.L.C. Agreement or other actions that may
impede the acquisition of control of the Fund by any person. </FONT></P>

During the past 60 days, the only transactions involving the Interests that were
effected by the Fund, the Adviser of the Fund, the Directors or any person
controlling the Fund or controlling the Adviser or any Directors of the Fund
were aggregate subscriptions of $26,693,492 in Interests from investors.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Based on February 1, 2004 estimated values, the Adviser beneficially owns
$1,105,561 in Interests and intends to tender substantially all of its Interests
in the Offer, except for approximately $15,000 in Interests. </FONT></P>

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences</B>.
The following discussion is a general summary of the federal income tax
consequences of the purchase of Interests by the Fund from investors pursuant to
the Offer. Investors should consult their own tax advisers for a complete
description of the tax consequences to them of a purchase of their Interests by
the Fund pursuant to the Offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An investor who tenders its entire Interest (and whose entire interest is
accepted) to the Fund for repurchase generally will recognize capital gain or
loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by such
investor (consisting of the 90% Cash Payment and the principal payment under the
Note) and such investor's adjusted tax basis in its Interest. Gain, if any, will
be recognized by a tendering investor only as and after the total proceeds
received by such investor exceed the investor's adjusted tax basis in its
Interest. A loss, if any, may be recognized after the tendering investor has
received payment under the Note. This capital gain or loss will be short-term or
long-term depending upon the investor's holding period for its Interest at the
time the gain or loss is recognized. Treasury Regulations provide that an
investor will have a divided (that is, fragmented) holding period for its
interest if the investor makes contributions to the Fund at different times.
Under the Treasury Regulations, each time the investor makes a contribution to
the Fund, the investor will have a new holding period for that portion of its
Interest determined by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the
contribution and the denominator of which is the investor's capital account
immediately after the contribution. Certain cash contributions, if made within
one year of a liquidating distribution, can be netted against the distribution.
If the investor recognizes capital gain or loss in connection with a complete
withdrawal from the Fund, the gain or loss is divided between long-term and
short-term capital gain or loss in the same proportions as the holding period of
the Interest is divided between the portion of the Interest held for more than
one year and the portion of the Interest held for one year or less. Interest on
the Notes is taxable to a tendering investor receiving such Notes under such
investor's method of accounting, subject to the possible application of certain
rules under the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations relating to
short-term obligations. A tendering investor will recognize ordinary income to
the extent such investor's allocable share of the Fund's &quot;unrealized
receivables&quot; exceeds the investor's basis in such unrealized receivables,
as determined pursuant to the Treasury Regulations. For these purposes, accrued
but untaxed market discount if any, on securities held by the Fund will be
treated as an unrealized receivable with respect to the tendering investor. An
investor who tenders less than its entire Interest to the Fund for repurchase
will recognize gain (but not loss) in a similar manner only to the extent that
the amount of the proceeds received (consisting of the 100% Cash Payment)
exceeds such investor's adjusted tax basis in its Interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pursuant to the authority granted to it under the L.L.C. Agreement, the Adviser
intends to specially allocate items of Fund capital gain, including short-term
capital gain, to a withdrawing investor to the extent its liquidating
distribution would otherwise exceed its adjusted tax basis in its Interest. Such
a special allocation may result in the withdrawing investor recognizing capital
gain, which may include short-term gain, in the investor's last taxable year in
the Fund, thereby potentially reducing the amount of any long-term capital gain
that, absent the special allocation, would otherwise have been recognized during
the tax year in which it receives its liquidating distribution upon withdrawal.

10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Treasury Regulations</B>. Treasury
Regulations require taxpayers that participate in "reportable transactions" to
disclose such participation to the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") (by
attaching Form 8886 to their tax returns and filing a copy of that Form with the
IRS Office of Tax Shelter Analysis) and comply with certain document retention
requirements. In addition, certain organizers and sellers of such a transaction
are required to maintain records, including lists identifying investors in the
transaction, and must furnish those records to the Service upon demand. A
transaction may be a "reportable transaction" based on any of several criteria,
one or more of which may be present with respect to an investment in or by the
Fund. These regulations are directed towards "tax shelters," however, they are
quite broad and may encompass transactions that typically would not be
considered "tax shelters." Investors should consult their own tax advisors
concerning any possible disclosure obligation they may have with respect to
their investment in the Fund and should be aware that the Fund (and perhaps
other participants in the transaction) intend to comply with the disclosure and
investor list maintenance requirements to the extent the Fund determines them to
apply with respect to this transaction and/or its investments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Notwithstanding any other provision or statement in any offering document of the
Fund (including the Prospectus and the L.L.C. Agreement), an investor (and each
employee, representative or other agent of the Investor) may disclose to any and
all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure
of the Fund and the offering of its interests and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the investor
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. For the avoidance of doubt,
this authorization is not intended to permit disclosure of the names of, or
other identifying information regarding, the participants in the transaction, or
of any information or the portion of any materials not relevant to the tax
treatment or tax structure of the transaction. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Miscellaneous</B>. The Offer is not being
made to, nor will tenders be accepted from, investors in any jurisdiction in
which the Offer or its acceptance would not comply with the securities or Blue
Sky laws of such jurisdiction. The Fund is not aware of any jurisdiction in
which the Offer or tenders pursuant thereto would not be in compliance with the
laws of such jurisdiction. However, the Fund reserves the right to exclude
investors from the Offer in any jurisdiction in which it is asserted that the
Offer cannot lawfully be made. The Fund believes such exclusion is permissible
under applicable laws and regulations, provided the Fund makes a good faith
effort to comply with any state law deemed applicable to the Offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Fund has filed an Issuer Tender Offer Statement on Schedule&#160;TO with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes certain information relating
to the Offer summarized herein. A free copy of such statement may be obtained
from the Fund by contacting PFPC at the address and phone number set forth on

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The undersigned hereby tenders to UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C., a closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment company organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware (the &quot;Fund&quot;), the limited liability company interest
in the Fund or portion thereof held by the undersigned, described and specified
below, on the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated
February 27, 2004 (&quot;Offer to Purchase&quot;), receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, and in this Letter of Transmittal (which together constituted the
&quot;Offer&quot;).
<B>The tender and this Letter of Transmittal are subject to all the terms and
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, including, but not limited to,
the absolute right of the Fund to reject any and all tenders determined by it,
in its sole discretion, not to be in the appropriate form.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The undersigned hereby sells to the Fund the limited liability company interest
in the Fund or portion thereof tendered hereby pursuant to the Offer. The
undersigned hereby warrants that the undersigned has full authority to sell the
limited liability company interest in the Fund or portion thereof tendered
hereby and that the Fund will acquire good title thereto, free and clear of all
liens, charges, encumbrances, conditional sales agreements or other obligations
relating to the sale thereof, and not subject to any adverse claim, when and to
the extent the same are purchased by it. Upon request, the undersigned will
execute and deliver any additional documents necessary to complete the sale in
accordance with the terms of the Offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The undersigned recognizes that under certain circumstances set forth in the
Offer, the Fund may not be required to purchase any of the limited liability
company interest in the Fund or portions thereof tendered hereby. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3><B>The undersigned acknowledges that the method of delivery of
any documents is at the election and the complete risk of the undersigned,
including, but not limited to, the failure of the Fund's Administrator, PFPC
Inc. (&quot;PFPC&quot;), to receive any Letter of Transmittal or other
document.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Payment of the cash portion of the purchase price for the limited liability
company interest in the Fund or portion thereof of the undersigned (the
&quot;Cash Payment&quot;), as described in Section 6 of the Offer to Purchase,
shall be sent to the undersigned by wire transfer to the&#160;undersigned's
brokerage account at UBS Financial Services Inc. (&quot;UBS Financial
Services&quot;) if such investor has a UBS Financial Services account. (The
undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned understands
that, for cash payments wired directly to an investor's brokerage account, upon
a withdrawal of such cash payment from such account, UBS Financial Services will
impose such fees as it would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from
such brokerage account.) If such investor does not have a UBS Financial Services
account, the Cash Payment will be sent directly to its mailing address as listed
in the Fund's records. A promissory note (&quot;Note&quot;) reflecting the
contingent payment portion of the purchase price, if any, as described in
Section 6 of the Offer to Purchase, will be held for such investor by PFPC. (Any
contingent payment due pursuant to the Note will be deposited directly to the
tendering investor's brokerage account at UBS Financial Services if such
investor has a UBS Financial Services account, and, upon a withdrawal of such
contingent payment from such account, UBS Financial Services will impose such
fees as it would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from such
brokerage account.) The undersigned recognizes that the amount of the Cash
Payment will be based on the unaudited estimated net asset value as of March 31,
2004, of the limited liability company interest or portion thereof tendered, and
that the contingent payment portion of the purchase price, if any, will be
determined upon completion of the audit of the Fund's financial statements for
calendar year 2004, which is anticipated to be completed not later than 60 days
after the Fund's fiscal year end, and will be paid in cash within approximately
ten days thereafter, or on such earlier date as the Fund's Directors may
determine. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Dear Investor:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the &quot;Fund&quot;) has received and
accepted your tender request. Enclosed is a statement showing the breakdown of
your capital withdrawal and the manner in which it is being distributed, in
accordance with the tender offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Since you have tendered your entire investment, you have been
paid 90% of the amount requested, in accordance with the terms of the tender
offer. The funds were wired directly into your UBS Financial Services brokerage
account if you have a UBS Financial Services account. If you do not have a UBS
Financial Services account, the funds were mailed directly in the form of a
check to you at your mailing address as listed in the Fund's records.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The remaining 10% of the amount requested is a contingent
portion of the repurchased interest and is valued based on the unaudited
estimated net asset value of the Fund as of March 31, 2004, and is subject to
year-end audit adjustments which may cause a change in the value of the
contingent portion of the repurchased interest. The contingent portion, together
with interest, will be paid (subject to audit adjustment) within approximately
ten days after the conclusion of the 2004 year-end audit, or on such earlier
date as the Fund's Directors may determine, according to the terms of the tender
offer. We expect the audit to be completed by the end of February 2005.
