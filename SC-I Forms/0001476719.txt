    business or assets, through a merger, capital stock exchange,

    share transaction or other similar business transaction. 57th
    Street consummated its initial public offer (its

    of one Common Share and one Warrant to purchase one Common Share
    on May&#160;28, 2010. The net proceeds of the IPO, together with

    57th Street GAC Holdings LLC, a limited liability company wholly

    &#147;Trust&#160;Account&#148;) pending completion by 57th
    Street of an initial business combination. If 57th Street does
    not consummate its initial business combination by
    August&#160;19, 2011, it must liquidate the Trust&#160;Account
    to the holders of the Common Shares issued in its IPO and

    the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, as disclosed

    Shares to provide our stockholders an opportunity to redeem
    their Common Shares for a pro-rata portion of our
    Trust&#160;Account upon our consummation of a business
    transaction. We also represented that in connection with this
    redemption opportunity, we would provide our securityholders

    financial and other information about our proposed business
    transaction and redemption rights that would otherwise be
    required under Regulation&#160;14A of the Exchange Act, which
    regulates the solicitation of proxies. Accordingly, we are
    making the Offer so that we may provide our securityholders with
    appropriate disclosure regarding the business and finances of
    57th Street, Crumbs and the post-transaction company so that our

    compliance with the DGCL may require that we submit a plan of
    dissolution and liquidation to our then existing stockholders

    have sought to redeem their Common Shares. Only upon our

    If we do not consummate a business transaction by

    limited liability company wholly owned by its officers,
    directors and advisors (our &#147;Sponsor&#148;), and our
    officers and directors have agreed that we will (i)&#160;cease
    all operations except for the purposes of winding up,
    (ii)&#160;redeem 100% of our public Common Shares for a per
    share pro rata portion of the Trust&#160;Account, plus a portion
    of the interest earned on the Trust&#160;Account but net of any
    taxes, subject to the requirements of Section&#160;160 of the
    DGCL and other applicable law and (iii)&#160;as promptly as
    possible following such redemption, dissolve and liquidate the
    balance of our net assets to our remaining stockholders. Under
    the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third
    parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions
    received by them pursuant to dissolution, and our redemption of
    100% of the Common Shares sold in the IPO may be deemed a
    liquidating distribution. If a corporation complies with certain
    procedures set forth in Section&#160;280 of the DGCL intended to
    ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against
    it, including a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">60-day</FONT>
    notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought
    against the corporation, a

    brought, and an additional
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">150-day</FONT>
    waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to
    stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a
    liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such
    stockholder&#146;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount
    distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the
    stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the
    dissolution. Because we will not be complying with certain
    procedures set forth in Section&#160;280 of the DGCL, as set
    forth above, a stockholder who received distributions in the
    redemption may be liable for the lesser of such
    stockholder&#146;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount
    distributed to the stockholder until the third anniversary of

    different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and

    January&#160;19, 2011, Crumbs was operating 34 stores, nine of
    which have been open for less than one year. Accordingly, you
    have limited information with which to evaluate Crumbs&#146;

    accurate as they would be if Crumbs had a longer history of

    financial and management resources on the development of

    to achieve or sustain revenue growth, profitability or positive
    cash flow in the future. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion

    This is because the profit margin on comparable store revenue is
    generally higher than the profit margin on new store openings,
    as comparable store revenue enable fixed costs to be spread over

    Crumbs competes for real estate and Crumbs&#146; inability to
    secure real estate in desirable locations or on favorable lease
    terms could impact Crumbs&#146; ability to grow. Crumbs&#146;
    leases generally have initial terms of between 10 and
    15&#160;years, and generally can be extended in up to five-year
    increments (at increased rates) if at all. Additionally, in
    certain instances, there may be change in control provisions in
    the lease which put Crumbs in a competitive disadvantage when
    negotiating extensions or which require Crumbs to get landlord
    consent for certain transactions including, in some cases, the
    proposed business transaction. All of its leases require a fixed
    annual rent, although some require the payment of additional
    rent if store revenue exceeds a negotiated amount. Crumbs&#146;
    leases include &#147;net&#148; leases, which require it to pay
    all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.
    Crumbs generally cannot cancel these leases. Additional sites
    that Crumbs may lease are likely to be subject to similar
    long-term non-cancelable leases. If an existing or future store
    is not profitable, and Crumbs decides to close a particular
    store, it may nonetheless be committed to perform its
    obligations under the applicable lease including, among other
    things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.
    In addition, as each of its leases expires, Crumbs may fail to
    negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or
    at all, which could cause it to close stores in desirable
    locations. Current locations of Crumbs&#146; stores may become
    unattractive as demographic patterns change.

    Crumbs depends on deliveries exclusively from its regional

    stores by single regional distributors could cause shortages or

    Additionally, because none of the Crumbs retail stores bake the

    addition, Crumbs will incur additional expenses associated with
    its SEC reporting requirements. A number of those requirements
    will require Crumbs to carry out activities it has not done
    previously. For example, in the future it is likely that under
    Section&#160;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Crumbs will need to
    document and test its internal control procedures, its
    management will need to assess and report on Crumbs&#146;
    internal control over financial reporting and its independent
    accountants will need to issue an opinion on that assessment and
    the effectiveness of those controls. Furthermore, if Crumbs
    identifies any issues in complying with those requirements (for
    example, if Crumbs or its accountants identified a material
    weakness or significant deficiency in Crumbs&#146; internal
    control over financial reporting), Crumbs could incur additional
    costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues
    could adversely affect Crumbs&#146; reputation or investor
    perceptions of Crumbs.

    The terms of the director and officer liability insurance
    maintained by Crumbs following the closing may not be sufficient
    to attract and retain directors. As a result, it may be more
    difficult for Crumbs to attract and retain qualified persons to
    serve on its board of directors or as executive officers.
    Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also
    prompt even more changes in governance and reporting
    requirements. Crumbs cannot predict or estimate the amount of
    additional costs Crumbs may incur or the timing of such costs.

    Crumbs&#146; success depends, in part, upon the popularity of
    its food products and its ability to develop new menu items that
    appeal to consumers. Shifts in consumer preferences away from
    Crumbs&#146; stores or its menu items, Crumbs&#146; inability to
    develop new menu items that appeal to consumers, or changes in
    Crumbs&#146; menu that eliminate items popular with some
    consumers could harm its business. Also, Crumbs&#146; success
    depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer
    spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and
    the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, Crumbs
    may experience declines in sales during economic downturns or
    during periods of uncertainty. Any material decline in the
    amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse
    effect on Crumbs&#146; sales, results of operations, business
    and financial condition.

    providing baked goods and coffee, on the basis of taste, quality
    and price of products offered, customer service, atmosphere,

    municipal levels on the food industry, including nutrition and

    It is expected that the payments that 57th Street may make under

    The tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers,
    asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other
    changes of control, or if, at any time, 57th Street elects an
    early termination of the tax receivable agreement, 57th
    Street&#146;s (or its successor&#146;s) obligations would be
    based on certain assumptions, including that 57th Street would
    have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the potential
    tax benefits arising from the Merger and related transactions
    (including as a result of entering into the tax receivable
    agreement). As a result, (i)&#160;57th Street could be required
    to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are
    greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual
    benefits it realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to
    the tax receivable agreement and (ii)&#160;if 57th Street elects
    to terminate the tax receivable agreement early, it would be
    required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value
    of the anticipated future tax benefits, which upfront payment
    may be made years in advance of the actual realization of such
    future benefits. In these situations, 57th Street&#146;s
    obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a
    substantial negative impact on its liquidity. There can be no

    will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under

    Crumbs was co-founded in 2003 as Crumbs Bake Shop in New York
    City by Mia Bauer and Jason Bauer. Crumbs has gained increasing
    brand recognition for its comfort-oriented and elegant baked
    goods, especially its gourmet cupcakes. Cupcake sales comprised
    approximately 77%, 79% and 78% of Crumbs&#146; gross operating
    revenue for the years ended December&#160;31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Crumbs believes that its baked goods appeal
    to a wide demographic of customers who span every socio-economic
    class. Crumbs operates in urban, suburban, commercial, and
    residential markets, and more recently, it has expanded into
    transportation hubs such as Union Station in
    Washington,&#160;D.C. and the Continental Airlines Terminal at
    Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey.

    The unaudited condensed consolidated pro forma financial
    statements reflect the Transaction will be accounted for as a
    recapitalization of Crumbs and management has concluded that
    Crumbs is the accounting acquirer based on its evaluation of the
    facts and circumstances of the acquisition. The purpose of the
    Transaction is to assist Crumbs with its business plan to
    expand. Of the two entities, Crumbs is the operating entity
    within the consolidated companies. The Members have the right to
    designate the initial board of 57th Street following the Merger
    and as holders of 57th Street Series&#160;A Voting Preferred
    Stock (as defined below) will have the right to appoint a
    majority of the directors during the Earnout Period. Two of
    Crumbs&#146; continuing board members will continue to serve on
    the 57th Street board of directors. Crumbs&#146; senior
    management will be continuing as senior management of the
    combined company. Although a larger portion of the voting rights
    in the combined entity will be held by former 57th Street
    stockholders, this was not considered determinative, as all
    other important elements considered in determining which party
    has control, including board of directors representation and
    management continuity were not aligned with this voting
    interest. Additionally, the 57th Street stockholders are
    expected to represent a diverse group of stockholders at
    completion of the Merger and we are not aware of any voting or
    other agreements that suggest that they can act as one party.

    The unaudited pro forma consolidated per share information
    reflects the merger being accounted for as a recapitalization of
    Crumbs and management has concluded that Crumbs is the
    accounting acquirer based on its evaluation of the facts and
    circumstances of the acquisition. The purpose of the Merger was
    to assist Crumbs with its business plan to expand. Of the two
    entities, Crumbs is the operating entity within the consolidated
    companies. The Members have the right to designate the initial
    board of 57th Street following the Merger and as holders of 57th
    Street Series&#160;A Voting Preferred Stock (as defined below)
    will have the right to appoint a majority of the directors
    during the Earnout Period. Two of Crumbs&#146; continuing board
    members will continue to serve on the 57th Street board of
    directors. Crumbs&#146; senior management will be continuing as
    senior management of the combined company. Although a larger
    portion of the voting rights in the combined entity will be held
    by former 57th Street stockholders, this was not considered
    determinative, as all other important elements considered in
    determining which party has control, including board of
    directors representation and management continuity were not
    aligned with this voting interest. Additionally, the 57th Street
    stockholders are expected to represent a diverse group of
    stockholders at completion of the Merger and we are not aware of
    any voting or other agreements that suggest that they can act as
    one party.

    <I>Opportunities to grow existing revenue streams and create new
    revenue streams associated with Crumbs.</I>&#160;&#160;An
    important criteria to 57th&#160;Street&#146;s board of directors
    in identifying a Transaction target was that the target business
    could support long term growth through economic cycles. The
    board of directors believes Crumbs&#146; infrastructure of
    branding, growth, customer loyalty, quality and intellectual
    capital are in place to facilitate such growth. Primary growth
    strategy includes operating an aggregate of 200 retail stores by
    2014, increasing

    investment criteria the board of directors reviewed was the
    existence of barriers to entry and Crumbs&#146; competitive
    position. Crumbs believes it is the creator of the gourmet
    cupcake, and the largest U.S.&#160;based retailer of cupcakes.
    Crumbs has developed unique and innovative recipes, and engaged
    the services of commercial bakers to deliver consistent quality
    products to each of its retail stores, as well as to customers

    57th&#160;Street&#146;s board of directors in identifying a
    Transaction target was that the target business had a management
    team with specialized knowledge of the markets within which it
    operates. Crumbs&#146; senior management team founded the
    business, and its largest investor facilitated the brand&#146;s
    rapid expansion. 57th&#160;Street&#146;s board of directors
    determined Crumbs&#146; management team has requisite knowledge
    and experience within the food and beverage industry, and

    Crumbs&#146; exclusive dependence on daily deliveries from only

    57th&#160;Street shall be entitled to recover from Crumbs or the

    At Closing, 57th Street has agreed to enter into a Tax
    Receivables Agreement with the Members reflecting the following
    terms and such other terms and conditions reasonably acceptable
    to the parties to the Business Combination Agreement. The
    payment of the Closing Merger Consideration other than the
    New&#160;Crumbs Class&#160;B Exchangeable Units will be a
    taxable exchange. In addition, the Members may (subject to the
    terms of the Exchange Agreement) exchange their New Crumbs
    Class&#160;B Exchangeable Units for Common Shares of 57th Street
    on a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">one-for-one</FONT>
    basis, which exchanges will also be taxable exchanges. Crumbs
    intends to make an election under Section&#160;754 of the Code
    effective for each taxable year in which a taxable exchange of
    New Crumbs Class&#160;B Exchangeable Units occurs, which may
    result in an adjustment to the tax basis of the assets of Crumbs
    at the time of any such taxable exchange. As a result of both
    this initial purchase and these subsequent exchanges, 57th
    Street, which we refer to as the &#147;corporate taxpayer&#148;,
    will become entitled to a proportionate share of the existing
    tax basis of the assets of Crumbs. All such taxable exchanges
    are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the
    assets of Crumbs that otherwise would not have been available.
    Both this proportionate share and these increases in tax basis
    may reduce the amount of tax that the corporate taxpayer would
    otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in
    tax basis may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future
    dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis
    is allocated to those capital assets. The IRS may challenge all
    or part of the existing tax basis, tax basis increase and
    increased deductions, and a court could sustain such a challenge.

    Class&#160;A Voting Units and the New Crumbs Class&#160;B
    Exchangeable Units will be made at the discretion of the board
    of managers of the Surviving Company and will be pro rata with
    respect to the number of New&#160;Crumbs Class&#160;A Voting
    Units and the New Crumbs Class&#160;B Exchangeable Units. The
    Surviving Company will endeavor to make distributions to holders
    of its New Crumbs Class&#160;A Voting Units and the New Crumbs
    Class&#160;B Exchangeable Units in an amount necessary to cover
    their tax obligations (including quarterly estimated taxes)
    attributable to their allocable share of Surviving Company
    income, with respect to any pre- and post-closing fiscal year,
    subject to availability of free cash, debt service obligations,
    and other legal restrictions. If other distributions made with
    respect to such fiscal year are not at least equal to such
    amount, the Surviving Company will (to the extent so permitted),
    make sufficient distributions to provide holders of New Crumbs
    Class&#160;A Voting Units and the New Crumbs Class&#160;B
    Exchangeable Units (and, in the case of holders which are
    pass-through entities for tax purposes, their members, partners
    or equity holders) with an amount equal to taxes (including
    quarterly estimated taxes) applicable to their respective
    allocable income at the highest rate applicable to any
    individual resident of New York City, subject to availability of
    free cash, debt service obligations, and other legal
    restrictions. The necessity of a tax distribution will be based
    on cumulative distributions made by the Surviving Company with
    respect to any fiscal year. Although the amount of the tax
    distribution is based on the highest rate applicable to any
    holder of a New Crumbs Class&#160;A Voting Units Class&#160;A
    Voting Unit or New Crumbs Class&#160;B Exchangeable Unit (or its
    flow-through members or partners), the same tax distribution per
    unit will be made to all holders of New Crumbs Class&#160;A
    Voting Units and the New Crumbs Class&#160;B Exchangeable Units,
    except with respect to any fiscal year prior to the completion
    of the Merger whereby only the holders of New Crumbs
    Class&#160;B Exchangeable Units shall be entitled to such tax
    distribution.

    of immediately prior to such transaction). Withholding and other
    taxes paid or payable by the Surviving Company in respect of the

    the Surviving Company. No distributions will be permitted to the

    violation of any financing agreement or if there is insufficient
    cash. Members of the Surviving Company will not be permitted to
    receive advances from the Surviving Company against their

    57th&#160;Street, Crumbs, the Members and the other parties
    thereto executed the Business Combination Agreement on
    January&#160;9, 2011 that provides for the acquisition of Crumbs
    by 57th&#160;Street for consideration consisting of cash and
    securities and amended such agreement on February&#160;18, 2011.
    In connection with the announcement of the Transaction on
    January&#160;10, 2011, 57th&#160;Street announced that it would
    offer to purchase, concurrent with the Merger, up to 4,801,544
    of its outstanding Common Shares and all 9,156,300 of its
    outstanding Warrants as contemplated by the Offer to Purchase.
    The Offer provides our securityholders an opportunity to redeem
    their Common Shares for a pro-rata portion of our
    Trust&#160;Account as required by our Certificate of
    Incorporation, and as disclosed in the prospectus for our IPO,
    and to redeem their Warrants for $1.00.

    Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, we also agreed

    well as opportunities for arbitrage that may adversely affect
    trading prices of our Securities. We believe the reduction in
    the number of outstanding Warrants will provide greater

    If the redemption qualifies as a sale of Common Shares by a

    recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the
    difference between the amount of cash received and the
    holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the shares. A holder&#146;s
    adjusted tax basis in the Common Shares generally will equal the
    holder&#146;s acquisition cost, and if the holder purchased
    57th&#160;Street&#146;s units, the cost of such units would be
    allocated between the Common Shares and the Warrants that
    comprised such units based on their relative fair market values
    at the time of purchase. Any such capital gain or loss
    recognized by a U.S.&#160;holder will be long-term capital gain
    or loss if the U.S.&#160;holder&#146;s holding period for the
    shares exceeds one year. A holder must calculate gain or loss
    separately for each block of Common Shares exchanged pursuant to
    the Offer (generally, shares acquired at the same cost in a
    single transaction). Long-term capital gain recognized by a
    non-corporate U.S.&#160;holder generally will be subject to a
    maximum tax rate of 15%. The deduction of capital losses is
    subject to limitations, as is the deduction for losses realized

    Whether an exchange of Common Shares for cash pursuant to the
    Offer qualifies for sale or distribution treatment will depend
    largely on the total number of Common Shares treated as held by
    the holder before and after the exchange (including any common
    stock constructively owned by the holder as a result of, among
    other things, owning Warrants). The exchange of Common Shares
    for cash pursuant to the Offer generally will be treated as a
    sale of the Common Shares (rather than as a corporate
    distribution) if the receipt of cash upon the redemption
    (i)&#160;is &#147;substantially disproportionate&#148; with
    respect to the holder, (ii)&#160;results in a &#147;complete
    termination&#148; of the holder&#146;s stock interest in us or
    (iii)&#160;is &#147;not essentially equivalent to a
    dividend&#148; with respect to the holder. These tests are

    In determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied,
    a holder takes into account not only Common Shares actually
    owned by the holder, but also Common Shares that are
    constructively owned by it. A holder may constructively own, in
    addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related

    that have an interest in such holder, as well as any stock the
    holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which

    of the Common Shares actually owned by the holder are redeemed
    and the holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in
    accordance with specific rules, the attribution of stock owned
    by certain family members and the holder does not constructively
    own any other stock in us. The exchange of Common Shares for
    cash pursuant to the Offer will be &#147;not essentially
    equivalent to a dividend&#148; if such exchange results in a
    &#147;meaningful reduction&#148; of the holder&#146;s
    proportionate interest in us. Whether the redemption will result
    in a meaningful reduction in a holder&#146;s proportionate
    interest will depend on the particular facts and circumstances.
    However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a
    small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small
    minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation who
    exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such
    a &#147;meaningful reduction.&#148; Contemporaneous dispositions
    or acquisitions of Common Shares by a holder or related persons
    may be deemed to be part of a single integrated transaction for

    treatment to it of tendering Common Shares pursuant to the
    Offer. A U.S.&#160;holder owning at least 1% of our outstanding

    minimum period during which a tender offer must remain open
    following material changes in the terms of the Offer or
    information concerning the Offer (other than a change in price
    or a change in percentage of securities sought) will depend on

    of the terms or information; however, in no event will the Offer
    remain open for fewer than five business days following such a
    material change in the terms of, or information concerning, the
    Offer. If (i)&#160;we make any change to increase the price to
    be paid for Common Shares, and (ii)&#160;the Offer is scheduled
    to expire at any time earlier than the expiration of a period
    ending on the tenth business day from, and including, the date
    that notice of an increase or decrease is first published, sent
    or given to stockholders in the manner specified in this
    section, the Offer will be extended until the expiration of such
    period of ten business days. For purposes of the Offer, a

    On May&#160;28, 2010, 57th Street consummated its IPO of
    5,456,300&#160;units, including 456,300&#160;units which were
    subject to the underwriters&#146; over-allotment option. The net
    proceeds of the IPO, including proceeds from the over-allotment
    option and from the private sale of 3,700,000 Warrants at a
    price of $0.50 per Warrant to 57th&#160;Street GAC Holdings,
    LLC, 57th Street&#146;s Sponsor, and underwriter of the IPO, and
    after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
    the offering expenses, were approximately $54,476,303. Such
    amount, including $600,193 of deferred underwriting commissions
    and discounts, was deposited into the Trust&#160;Account and
    invested in government securities. As of December&#160;31, 2010
    we had approximately $415,360 (including $18,447 of interest we
    earned on funds in the Trust&#160;Account, which we are entitled
    to in order to cover our operating expenses and the costs
    associated with our plan of dissolution and liquidation if we do
    not consummate a business transaction) that we may use to cover
    our operating expenses until August&#160;19, 2011, and to cover
    the expenses incurred in connection with a business transaction.
    Except as set forth above, no funds in the Trust&#160;Account
    have been released and only the remaining interest income that
    57th Street may use for working capital requirements and amounts
    necessary for its tax obligations will be released until the
    earlier of the consummation of a business transaction or the
    liquidation of 57th Street. The Trust&#160;Account contained
    $54,496,691.73 as of January&#160;31, 2011.

    assets to our remaining stockholders, as part of our plan of
    dissolution and liquidation to be adopted in accordance with
    Section&#160;281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
    Pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our

    consummating a business transaction will automatically

    although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient
    funds for such purpose. If such funds are insufficient, our

    upon our redemption of 100% of our public Common Shares in the
    event we do not consummate our initial business transaction by
    August&#160;19, 2011&#160;may be considered a liquidation
    distribution under Delaware law. If 57th Street complies with
    certain procedures set forth in Section&#160;280 of the Delaware
    General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes
    reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">60-day</FONT>
    notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought
    against the corporation, a
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">90-day</FONT>
    period during which the corporation may reject any claims
    brought, and an additional
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">150-day</FONT>
    waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to
    stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a
    liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such
    stockholder&#146;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount
    distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the
    stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the
    dissolution. However, as stated above, if we do not consummate a
    business transaction within the requisite time, it is our
    intention to make liquidating distributions to our stockholders
    as soon as reasonably possible following August&#160;19, 2011,
    and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those
    procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be
    liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by
    them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may
    extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. Because
    we will not be complying with Section&#160;280,
    Section&#160;281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law
    requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such
    time, that will provide for our payment of all existing and
    pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against
    us within the subsequent 10&#160;years. However, because we are
    a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our
    operations have been limited to searching for prospective target
    businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be
    from our vendors (such as accountants, lawyers, investment
    bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. We have sought
    to have all vendors, service providers and prospective target
    businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title,
    interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the
    Trust&#160;Account. The claims that could be made against us are
    significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that
    would result in any liability extending to the
    Trust&#160;Account is remote. Mark D. Klein, our chairman, chief
    executive officer and president, and Paul D. Lapping, our chief
    financial officer, treasurer, secretary and director, have
    agreed that they will be liable to us if and to the extent any
    claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us,
    or a prospective target business with which we have discussed
    entering into a transaction agreement reduce the amounts in the
    Trust&#160;Account to below approximately $9.98 per share,
    except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver
    of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust&#160;Account
    and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the
    underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including
    liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an
    executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third
    party, Messrs.&#160;Klein and Lapping will not be responsible to
    the extent of any liability for such third party claims.

    If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary
    bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the
    proceeds held in the Trust&#160;Account could be subject to

    estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority
    over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any
    bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust&#160;Account, we cannot
    assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders
    an aggregate of at least $9.98 per share. Additionally, if we

    stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the
    proceeds held in the Trust&#160;Account to our public
    stockholders promptly after the termination of our corporate
    existence, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving
    preference to our public stockholders over any potential
    creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our
    assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached
    its fiduciary duty to our creditors

    claims deplete the Trust&#160;Account, 57th Street cannot assure
    you it will be able to return to its public stockholders at
    least $9.98 per share.

    consummation of a business transaction, subject to certain
    limited exceptions. On May&#160;28, 2010, the Sponsor forfeited

    proceeds of $1,850,000. All of the proceeds received from the
    sale of the Insider Warrants ($1,850,000) were placed in the
    Trust&#160;Account. Each Insider Warrant entitles the holder to
    purchase from us one share of our common stock at a price of

    Crumbs was co-founded in 2003 as Crumbs Bake Shop in New York
    City by Mia Bauer and Jason Bauer. Prior to the formation of
    Crumbs, the brand Crumbs Bake Shop was being operated by seven
    individual corporations under the control of common ownership.
    Crumbs was formed in March 2008 for the purpose of establishing
    new ownership interests in Crumbs Bake Shop. On March&#160;5,
    2008, the seven individual corporations contributed assets to
    certain limited liability companies. The corporations were then
    merged into Crumbs, Inc. After the merger, Crumbs, Inc.
    contributed its membership interests in the limited liability
    companies to Crumbs in exchange for Class&#160;A membership
    units. In the current structure, a new limited liability company
    is formed for each Crumbs retail store location and Crumbs is
    the sole member of those new limited liability companies. New
    limited liability companies have been formed for Crumbs&#146;
    non-retail sales operations, including its wholesale, catering
    and
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">e-commerce</FONT>
    divisions, as well. There are currently 40 limited liability
    companies of which Crumbs is the sole member.

    Crumbs offers a wide variety of cakes, pies, cookies and other
    baked treats. Cupcake sales comprised approximately 77%, 79% and
    78% of Crumbs&#146; gross operating revenue for the years ended
    December&#160;31, 2010, December&#160;31, 2009, and
    December&#160;31, 2008, respectively. Crumbs believes that its
    baked goods appeal to a wide demographic of customers who span
    every socio-economic class. Crumbs operates in urban, suburban,
    commercial, and residential markets. More recently, it has
    expanded into transportation hubs, such as Union Station in
    Washington,&#160;D.C. and the Continental Airlines Terminal at
    Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey.

    All Crumbs stores are company owned and have been designed to
    possess a warm and inviting ambiance that resembles the look of
    old-fashioned European caf&#233;s, with glass display cases and
    vintage cake stands showcasing baked goods that sit high upon
    marble counters. On the walls are white vintage subway tiles,

    Crumbs carefully screens prospective locations for visibility,
    traffic patterns, demographics and convenience. Crumbs selects
    locations for new markets by targeting concentrations of daytime
    populations that it believes will try the Crumbs experience and
    spread positive
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">word-of-mouth</FONT>
    about the brand. In addition, Crumbs looks for high traffic
    locations within urban areas and based on the success of those
    operations, seeks to expand to the immediately surrounding
    suburban areas. Crumbs&#146; expansion strategy involves using
    an approach that clusters stores in a geographical region.
    Crumbs believes this approach has the potential to increase
    brand awareness and improve operating and marketing
    efficiencies. Crumbs also believes that clustering helps to
    reduce costs associated with regional supervision of store
    operations, increase distribution efficiencies and provide it
    with the opportunity to leverage marketing costs over a greater
    number of stores. Furthermore, Crumbs believes its ability to
    hire qualified team members is enhanced in markets in which it
    is well known.

    As of December&#160;31, 2010, Crumbs had approximately 50
    wholesale accounts in the New York City area that purchase
    Crumbs&#146; products and sell them in their venues as
    &#147;CRUMBS&#148; cupcakes, which enhances Crumbs&#146; brand
    awareness in the marketplace. Crumbs&#146; wholesale operations
    are focused on building relationships with leading retailers to
    offer Crumbs&#146; products. Generally, these retailers are
    concentrated in the food service and amusement industries.
    Although Crumbs offers to retailers all of its products sold
    through its wholesale operations, wholesale operations to date
    have been cupcake offerings. All of the products that Crumbs
    sells through its wholesale operations are branded, proprietary
    and packaged appropriately as &#147;CRUMBS&#148; products for
    retail customers. Crumbs plans to phase out its wholesale
    operations by 2012.

    The industry that Crumbs competes in is intensely competitive.
    Crumbs&#146; traditional and non-traditional stores and other
    business operations compete with well established national,
    regional and locally-owned traditional bakeries, cupcake
    specific bakeries, caf&#233;s and other companies providing
    baked goods and coffee. Additionally, Crumbs competes with
    certain quick-service restaurants, delicatessens, specialty food
    stores, take-out food service companies, supermarkets and
    convenience stores. The principal factors on which Crumbs
    competes are taste, quality, price of products offered, customer
    service, atmosphere, location, convenience and overall customer
    experience. Crumbs competes for leased space in desirable
    locations and some of its competitors may have capital resources
    greater than Crumbs&#146;. Many of Crumbs&#146; competitors or

    Crumbs has set a goal of operating 200 Crumbs stores in the

    Florida, Houston, San&#160;Diego, San&#160;Francisco and
    Seattle. In 2011, Crumbs plans to open 15 to 21 stores in
    current markets and intends to expand into additional
    transportation hubs like airports and train stations. Currently,
    Crumbs will seek to open 40 to 45 stores in new markets in 2012.

    municipal levels on the food industry, including nutrition and
    advertising practices. For example, several states and
    individual municipalities, including New York City and the state

    The average size of Crumbs&#146; stores is approximately
    950&#160;square feet. Crumbs leases all of its stores. Although
    lease terms for its stores vary, leases are typically
    10&#160;years with renewal options at most locations. The leases
    generally require Crumbs to pay a proportionate share of real
    estate taxes, insurance, common area, and other operating costs.
    Seven store leases, five in California and two in
    Washington,&#160;D.C., provide for contingent rental (i.e.
    percentage rent) payments based on sales in excess of specified
    amounts. Crumbs&#146; leases also generally provide for
    scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental
    payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial
    occupancy. See Note&#160;1 to the consolidated financial
    statements for further information on Crumbs&#146; accounting

    Crumbs leases all of its retail store locations and its
    corporate offices. The leases range in term from five to
    15&#160;years, many with options to extend up to 20&#160;years.
    Most of the leases include periods of free rent and monthly
    rental rate escalation clauses. Crumbs amortizes the total rent
    to be paid during the lease term on a straight line basis over
    the entire base period of each lease. This treatment causes a

    Revenue was $31&#160;million and $23.5&#160;million for the
    fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively, an increase of
    $7.5&#160;million or 32%. This increase was driven primarily by
    a $5.7&#160;million increase of revenue from 13 new stores
    opened at various times during fiscal year 2009 and a $747,000
    increase from the opening of eight stores since the end of
    fiscal year 2009, of which seven stores opened in the last two
    months of fiscal year 2010. In addition, same store sales
    increased $198,000 from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2010 for
    the 12&#160;stores that opened prior to January&#160;1, 2009. As
    of December&#160;31, 2010 Crumbs operated 34 stores.

    of Sales, as a percentage of revenue, fell just under 1% to
    41.3% of revenue. This decrease was primarily attributable to
    improved inventory management by store managers and district
    managers of both Crumbs&#146; products and packaging along with

    For fiscal year 2009, Crumbs ended the year on target with its
    projections for both cash and net working capital. For the
    fiscal year 2010, Crumbs ended the year with a working capital
    deficit of $1,066,700. There are two primary factors that
    impacted Crumbs&#146; plan for fiscal year 2010. First, the
    general contractor for one of Crumbs&#146; new locations failed
    to perform, resulting in an 11&#160;month delayed opening. A net
    loss of approximately $230,000, coupled with the loss of an
    anticipated $180,000 profit and an additional capital expense of
    $100,000, cost approximately $500,000 in total working capital.
    Second, in order to take advantage of The Small Business Jobs
    Act of 2010 (the &#147;Small Business Jobs Act&#148;), which
    initially provided for an extension of 50% bonus depreciation
    under Internal Revenue Code Section&#160;168(k) through
    December&#160;31, 2010, Crumbs accelerated some of its new store
    construction schedules, in an effort to take advantage of this
    deduction resulting in a cost to working capital. Accounts
    Payable related to these store construction projects totaled
    approximately $639,000 at December&#160;31, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV style="margin-top: 6pt; font-size: 1pt">&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%; text-indent: 4%; font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times; color: #000000; background: transparent">
    In order to restore the working capital, Crumbs has planned for
    only two new store projects for the first quarter of fiscal year
    2011. One of those projects has the majority of the improvements
    being supplied by the landlord and Crumbs&#146; projected cost
    is significantly less than its average construction cost. In
    addition, the Small Business Jobs Act amended Internal Revenue
    Code Section&#160;168(k) again to expand bonus depreciation to
    100% of capital cost and extend provision through
    December&#160;31, 2012. This will significantly reduce the
    working capital needed for income tax distributions in April of
    2011.

    Crumbs store openings from March of 2008 to December&#160;31,
    2010 were funded through the capital infusion of
    $7.0&#160;million resulting from a cash contribution to Crumbs
    and profits from ongoing store operations. Crumbs expects that
    the expansion plan to increase from 34 locations to over 200
    locations by the end of fiscal year 2014 is to be funded by an
    anticipated capital infusion in connection with the Merger with
    57th Street and profits from ongoing store operations.

    Based on Crumbs&#146; cash on hand, cash flow from operations
    and anticipated cash infusions as discussed above, Crumbs
    believes that it will have the working capital resources
    necessary to meet its projected operational needs for fiscal
    2011. However, if Crumbs requires more capital for growth or
    experiences operating losses, Crumbs believes that it will be
    necessary to obtain additional working capital through credit
    arrangements or debt or equity financings. There can be no
    assurance that this or other financings will be available if
    needed.

    In lieu of security deposits required pursuant to the terms of
    several operating leases, Crumbs has chosen to obtain letters of
    credit issued by two financial institutions. As of
    December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009, issued and unused letters of
    credit totaled $529,425 and $580,245, respectively. A base loan
    was issued to Crumbs by one of the financial institutions in
    connection with the letters of credit in the form of a $575,000
    revolving line of credit. Letters of credit amounting to
    $499,425 and $550,245 were reserved under this line of credit as

    Crumbs results of operations are generally affected by the
    economic trends in its market areas due to the dependence on its
    customers&#146; discretionary spending. Weakness in the national
    or regional economy in Crumbs&#146; market areas, combined with
    other factors including inflation, labor and healthcare costs
    and the availability of suitable locations for future stores,
    may negatively impact its business. If consumer activities
    associated with the use of Crumbs&#146; products decline or the
    business activities of Crumbs&#146; corporate customers
    decrease, its revenues and sales volumes may decline.

    carrying value of the asset to the asset&#146;s estimated future
    cash flows (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment
    loss is calculated based on the asset&#146;s estimated fair
    value. The fair value of the assets is estimated using a
    discounted cash flow model based on future store revenues and
    operating costs, using internal projections. Property and
    equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there
    are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash
    flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store
    level. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the
    lower of their carrying amount, or fair value less estimated
    costs to sell.

    On January&#160;9, 2011, 57th Street entered into a Business
    Combination Agreement (as it may be amended from time to time,
    the &#147;Business Combination Agreement&#148;) with Crumbs
    Holdings LLC, the members of Crumbs (&#147;Members&#148;) and
    the representatives of Crumbs and the Members, which was
    subsequently amended on February&#160;18, 2011, pursuant to
    which a subsidiary of 57th&#160;Street would merge with and into
    Crumbs, with Crumbs surviving as a non-wholly-owned subsidiary
    of 57th&#160;Street (the &#147;Merger&#148;). The Merger will be
    accounted for as a recapitalization of Crumbs and management has
    concluded that Crumbs is the accounting acquirer based on its
    evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the acquisition.
    The purpose of the Merger was to assist Crumbs with its business
    plan to expand. Of the two entities, Crumbs is the operating
    entity within the consolidated companies. The Members have the
    right to designate the initial board of 57th Street following
    the Merger and as holders of 57th Street Series&#160;A Voting
    Preferred Stock (as defined below) will have the right to
    appoint a majority of the directors during the Earnout Period.
    Two of Crumbs&#146; continuing board members will continue to
    serve on the 57th Street board of directors. Crumbs&#146; senior
    management will be continuing as senior management of the
    combined company. Although a larger portion of the voting rights
    in the combined entity will be held by former 57th Street
    stockholders, this was not considered determinative, as all
    other important elements considered in determining which party
    has control, including board of directors representation and
    management continuity were not aligned with this voting
    interest. Additionally, the 57th Street stockholders are
    expected to represent a diverse group of stockholders at
    completion of the Merger and we are not aware of any voting or
    other agreements that suggest that they can act as one party.

    held by our stockholders who hold Common Shares purchased as
    part of the units in our IPO (the &#147;Public Shares&#148;),
    our founders and Sponsor, the Members and others after the
    Transaction is completed. The following is based on our issued
    and outstanding Common Shares as of February&#160;17, 2011.
    Depending on the scenario, the current holders of our common
    stock (including holders of Common Shares and our founders and
    Sponsor) will hold from 13.19% to 73.50% of our voting interests
    after the Transaction. The table assumes that no holders of
    Common Shares tender their stock and provides for the tender of

    prospective target business to the extent necessary to ensure
    that the amounts in the Trust&#160;Account available for
    distribution to our stockholders do not fall below $9.98 per
    share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a
    waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the
    Trust&#160;Account and except as to any claims under our
    indemnity of the underwriters in the IPO against certain
    liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of

    to be unenforceable against a third party, Messrs.&#160;Klein
    and Lapping will not be responsible to the extent of any
    liability for such third party claims. In the event that the

    less than $9.98 per share.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
    audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    Crumbs Holdings LLC (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a Delaware
    limited liability company (LLC)&#160;formed in March 2008 for
    the purpose of establishing new ownership interests in Crumbs
    Bake Shop, a New York-based baked goods shop opened in 2003.
    Prior to the formation of the Company, the brand Crumbs Bake
    Shop was being operated by seven individual corporations under
    the control of common ownership. On March&#160;5, 2008, these
    corporations contributed assets to LLC&#146;s. The corporations
    were then merged into Crumbs, Inc. After the merger, Crumbs,
    Inc. contributed its membership interests in the LLC&#146;s to
    the Company in exchange for Class&#160;A membership units.

    The Company specializes in the sale of comfort-oriented and
    elegant baked goods, with more than 150&#160;varieties of goods

    merchandise. Sales are primarily conducted through retail
    locations in New York, California, Connecticut and New Jersey,
    while a small percentage of baked goods sales stem from
    wholesale distribution and catering sales to several New York
    metropolitan area vendors. The Company also commenced its
    <FONT style="white-space: nowrap">e-commerce</FONT>
    business in early 2009 enabling nationwide cupcake sales.

    When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values
    of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company
    evaluates long-lived assets for impairment. The Company first
    compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset&#146;s
    estimated future cash flows (undiscounted). If the estimated
    future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset,
    an impairment loss is calculated based on the asset&#146;s
    estimated fair value. The fair value of the assets is estimated
    using a discounted cash flow model based on future store
    revenues and operating costs, using internal projections.
    Property and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level
    for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing
    impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are identified at the
    individual store level. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are
    reported at the lower of their carrying amount, or fair value
    less estimated costs to sell.

    In lieu of security deposits required pursuant to the terms of
    several operating leases, the Company has chosen to obtain
    letters of credit issued by two financial institutions, where
    such substitution is allowed by the landlords. As of
    December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009, issued and unused letters of
    credit totaled $529,425 and $580,245, respectively. A base loan
    was issued to the Company by one of the financial institutions
    in connection with the letters of credit in the form of a
    $575,000 revolving line of credit, with a variable rate based on
    the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. Letters of credit amounting
    to $499,425 and $550,245 were reserved under this line of credit
    as of December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and
    therefore cannot exceed $575,000. The line of credit is
    guaranteed by one of the Company&#146;s members. The remaining
    $30,000 letter of credit at the second institution is secured by
    a certificate of deposit. No amounts were outstanding at
    December&#160;31, 2010 and 2009.

    it may have against the Trust&#160;Fund and/or Distributions now

    If backup withholding tax applies, the Depositary is required to
    withhold 28% (or the then prevailing rate) of any payments made
    to the shareholder. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
    Rather, the U.S.&#160;federal income tax liability of persons
    subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of
    tax withheld. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of
    taxes, a refund may be obtained, provided the required
    information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis.

    If backup withholding tax applies, the Depositary is required to
    withhold 28% (or the then prevailing rate) of any payments made
    to the warrantholder. Backup withholding is not an additional
    tax. Rather, the U.S.&#160;federal income tax liability of
    persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the
    amount of tax withheld. If backup withholding results in an
    overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained, provided the
    required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis.

    Purchase Price to tendering holders pursuant to this Offer not
    exceeding $9,156,300 (which we refer to as the &#147;Cash
