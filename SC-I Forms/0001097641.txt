                         SUMMARY - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

            724 Solutions Inc., which we refer to as "we", "the Company" "us" or
"724 Solutions", is offering eligible employees the opportunity to exchange all
eligible options for new options that we will grant under the 724 Solutions Inc.
2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated (the "2000 Plan"). We are making
this offer upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this offer
to exchange and in the related cover letter and acceptance letter (which
together constitute the "offer").

            The following are answers to some of the questions that you may have
about this offer. We urge you to read carefully the following summary of this
offer to exchange, the remainder of this offer to exchange and the accompanying
acceptance letter attached to the end of this document, because the information
in these questions and answers is not complete, and additional important
information is contained in the remainder of this offer to exchange and the
other documents. Cross-references to sections are to the applicable sections of
this offer to exchange.

DESCRIPTION OF THE OFFER

Q1.  WHY ARE WE MAKING THE OFFER?

            Many of our outstanding options have exercise prices that are
significantly higher than the current market price of our common shares. Given
the uncertainty of current market conditions, we believe that employees may feel
that their opportunity to realize any value from existing options is limited. By
making this offer to exchange eligible options, as defined below, for new
options that will have an exercise price equal to the market price of our common
shares on the grant date, we intend to provide our employees with the benefit of
owning options that over time may have a greater potential to increase in value,
to create better performance incentives for employees and to maximize
shareholder value. (Section 2.)

Q2.  WHAT SECURITIES ARE WE OFFERING TO EXCHANGE?

            We are offering to exchange all eligible options granted to eligible
employees, as defined below, for new options to be granted under the 2000 Plan.
"Eligible options" are only those currently outstanding options granted to
eligible employees under the 724 Solutions Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan, as
amended and restated (the "1997 Plan"), the Tantau Software Inc. 1999 Stock
Option Plan, as amended and restated (the "Tantau Plan"), and the 2000 Plan (all
of such plans collectively, the "option plans"), that have an exercise price of
more than U.S.$3.00 if the exercise price is denominated in United States
currency or more than Cdn.$4.75 if denominated in Canadian currency. In the case
of the Tantau Plan, only options granted after January 15, 2001 are eligible
options. (Section 1.).

Q3.  ARE THE OPTIONS RECENTLY GRANTED TO ME IN JULY 2001 ELIGIBLE OPTIONS?

            Yes.  The options recently granted to you in July 2001 are eligible
options and must be tendered if you want to participate in this offer.
(Section 11.)

                                       3

<PAGE>


Q4.  WHO QUALIFIES AS AN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE?

            An "eligible employee" is an employee of 724 Solutions or one of its
subsidiaries, who is an employee on January 24, 2002 and on the date the offer
expires, and who principally resides in Canada (other than in the Province of
Quebec), the United States, the United Kingdom (other than Scotland) or Germany.
"Eligible employees" excludes members of 724 Solutions' board of directors and
724 Solutions' officers, and other selected senior employees of 724 Solutions
and its subsidiaries who will be separately notified on the date hereof by 724
Solutions of their ineligibility. However, in the case of an employee who is an
expatriate (i.e., an employee who is on an approved international assignment) or
who is transferred to another location in the course of employment, "eligible
employee" includes only those employees who on both January 24, 2002 and on the
date the offer expires are principally resident in a permitted jurisdiction
listed in this paragraph. In addition, an employee will not be considered an
"eligible employee" and, accordingly, will not be eligible to participate in
this offer if, on or before the date the offer expires, such employee:

            - receives a notice of involuntary termination (including, without
              limitation, redundancy) from 724 Solutions or one of its
              subsidiaries;

            - resigns or gives notice of resignation from such employment;

            - retires or elects to retire from such employment;

            - enters into an agreement with 724 Solutions or one of its
              subsidiaries with respect to such employee's resignation or
              retirement; or

            - otherwise ceases to be an "eligible individual" for purposes of
              the 2000 Plan,

unless on the expiration date of the offer the employee is an employee of 724
Solutions or one of its subsidiaries, in respect of which none of these events
has occurred. (Section 1.)

            See Section 10 for a description of other options that we have
issued or may issue in connection with this offer.

Q5.  WHEN WILL THE NEW OPTIONS BE GRANTED?

            Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this offer and as
promptly as practicable following the expiration of the offer at 11:59 p.m.,
eastern standard time, on February 21, 2002 unless extended, we expect to accept
for exchange and cancel eligible options properly tendered and not validly
withdrawn on or before the expiration date and to notify all eligible employees
who have tendered their eligible options of our acceptance. We will grant new
options on the day that is six months and one day after the date of cancellation
(subject to our right to grant new options earlier, as described below).
(Section 5.)

            We currently expect to accept and cancel eligible options by
February 28, 2002. If on February 28, 2002 we cancel eligible options accepted
for exchange, you will be granted new options on August 29, 2002, subject to the
conditions described below. If the offer is extended, then the grant date of the
new options will also be extended if necessary to ensure that the new option
grant date is at least six months and one day following the date eligible
options are cancelled. (Section 5.)

            However, we reserve the right to grant new options earlier than the
day that is six months and one day after the date of cancellation, if we
determine that it is in the best interests of 724 Solutions

                                       4

<PAGE>


and our shareholders to do so. This could occur, for example, if we are party
to a merger or a similar transaction during this period. In such event, we
will notify eligible employees, which may be by press release, of the earlier
new option grant date. (Section 5.)

Q6.  HOW MANY NEW OPTIONS WILL I RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY TENDERED OPTIONS?

            If all of your eligible options are properly tendered and cancelled
in the offer and you are entitled to receive new options, the number of common
shares subject to the new options will be equal to the number of common shares
subject to the eligible options that are accepted for exchange and cancelled
regardless of whether or to what extent the cancelled options are then vested,
subject to adjustments for any future stock splits, certain stock dividends and
similar events in accordance with the terms of the 2000 Plan. Each new option
will entitle the eligible employee to purchase common shares in accordance with
the terms of the 2000 Plan and the applicable stock option agreement between the
employee and 724 Solutions. (Section 8.)

Q7.  WHEN WILL THE NEW OPTIONS VEST?

            The terms of the new grants to be made to employees participating in
the offer will provide that new options in respect of 25% of the common shares
that may be purchased under the new grants will vest at the time of grant of the
new options, with an additional 25% vesting on each anniversary date of the
grant of the new options until all such new options are exercisable, subject to
the other provisions of the 2000 Plan that could cause options to vest early or
to terminate. Accordingly, by the third anniversary date of the new grant, the
new options will be fully vested. (Section 8.)

Q8.  WHAT WILL THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE NEW OPTIONS BE?

            The exercise price of the new options will be the market price of
our common shares, determined by reference to their closing sale price on The
Toronto Stock Exchange (for employees resident in Canada) and on the NASDAQ
National Market (for employees resident outside of Canada) on the last trading
day immediately preceding the new option grant date. For new options intended to
be incentive stock options, the exercise price will be no less than 110% of the
fair market value of the common shares on the date of grant if the eligible
employee owning such new options has more than 10% of the voting power of all
classes of shares of 724 Solutions or any parent or subsidiary, as defined in
the 2000 Plan. (Section 8.)

            Because the new options will be granted at least six months and one
day following the date eligible options are cancelled, we cannot predict the
exercise price of the new options. Accordingly, the new options may have a
higher exercise price than some or all of your eligible options that are
cancelled in the offer. The new options may also have an exercise price that is
lower than that applicable to some or all of your eligible options. The exercise
price may be higher or lower than the prices at which our common shares have
recently traded. We recommend that you obtain current market quotations for our
common shares before deciding whether to tender your eligible options. See
Section 7 of the offer to exchange for information concerning the trading price
of our common shares since January 28, 2000.

<PAGE>

Q9. WILL THE TERMS OF MY NEW OPTIONS BE THE SAME AS THE TERMS OF MY ELIGIBLE
OPTIONS?

            The new options will be granted under the 2000 Plan. The terms and
conditions of the new options may vary from the terms and conditions of the
eligible options issued under the 1997 Plan or the Tantau Plan, and vary from
the terms and conditions of eligible options granted under the 2000 Plan before
January 23, 2002. The material terms and conditions of the new options and the
2000 Plan, and the material differences between the terms and conditions of the
eligible options and the new options, are discussed below under Section 8 in the
offer to exchange.

Q10.  WHAT DOES 724 SOLUTIONS AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS THINK OF THIS OFFER?

            We are making the offer for the reasons described in question and
answer 1. Although our board of directors has approved the making of this offer,
neither we nor our board of directors makes any recommendation as to whether you
should tender or refrain from tendering your eligible options. It is for you to
decide whether to participate in the offer; you must make your own decision
whether to tender eligible options. (Section 2.)

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS
- ---------------------------

Q11.  WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT DATES THAT I NEED TO REMEMBER?

            The offer commences today, January 24, 2002. You will receive by
mail, in the next few days, a statement of your holdings of eligible options.
(Section 1).

            The offer expires on February 21, 2002, at 11:59 p.m., eastern
standard time, unless we extend it. (Section 1).

            You may withdraw your tendered eligible options at any time before
the expiration of the offer. In addition, unless we accept your tendered
eligible options for exchange before 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time, on March
21, 2002, you may withdraw your tendered options at any time after March 21,
2002. (Section 4).

            As promptly as practicable following the expiration of the offer, we
expect to accept for exchange and cancel eligible options properly tendered and
not validly withdrawn before the expiration and to notify all eligible employees
who have tendered their eligible options of our acceptance. We will grant new
options on the day that is six months and one day after the date of cancellation
(subject to our right to grant new options earlier, as described above). We
currently expect to accept and cancel eligible options by February 28, 2002. If
on February 28, 2002 we cancel eligible options accepted for exchange, you will
be granted new options on August 29, 2002, subject to the conditions described
below (and subject to our right to grant new options earlier). (Section 5).

Q12. HOW CAN I FIND OUT THE DETAILS OF MY OUTSTANDING OPTIONS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE
FOR THIS OFFER?

            You will receive by mail, shortly after the date of this offer, a
personalized statement as to the details of your eligible options.  (Section
1.)

                                       6

<PAGE>

Q13.  WHEN DOES THE OFFER EXPIRE? CAN THE OFFER BE EXTENDED, AND IF SO,
HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF IT IS EXTENDED?

            The offer expires on February 21, 2002, at 11:59 p.m., eastern
standard time, unless we extend it. Although we do not currently intend to do
so, we may, in our discretion, extend the offer at any time. If the offer is
extended, we will make an announcement of the extension no later than 9:00 a.m.
eastern standard time on the business day immediately following the previously
scheduled expiration of the offer period. If the offer is extended, then the
last date for withdrawal of tendered options, the cancellation date for tendered
eligible options accepted for exchange and the grant date of the new options may
be extended if necessary to comply with applicable securities laws and to avoid
the possibility that we would have to recognize any charges in our financial
statements which would reduce our reported earnings. (Sections 11 and 13.)

Q14.  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO TENDER MY ELIGIBLE OPTIONS?

            If you wish to participate in this offer, you need to "tender" your
eligible options for exchange, which means that you must deliver to us the
signed signature page of the acceptance letter (using the form attached as
Exhibit 1 at the end of this document). For your tender of eligible options to
be effective, we must receive, before 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time, on
February 21, 2002 (or before any extended expiration date for the offer), the
signature page of the acceptance letter, properly completed and signed by you.
The signed signature page must be delivered to us and received at 724 Solutions
Inc., Attention: Calvin Barrett, 10 York Mills Road, 3rd Floor, Toronto,
Ontario, M2P 2G4, facsimile: (416) 228-2350. We will only accept delivery of the
signed signature page of the acceptance letter by facsimile, inter-office mail,
courier or regular external mail. If you choose to deliver your signature page
by external mail, we recommend that you use registered mail with return receipt
requested. You must allow for delivery time based on the method of delivery that
you choose to ensure we receive your acceptance letter on time. Delivery by
e-mail will NOT be accepted. THE DELIVERY OF ALL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE
AND WITHDRAWAL LETTERS, IS AT YOUR RISK. WE URGE YOU TO SEND SUCH DOCUMENTS BY
FACSIMILE, COURIER OR REGISTERED MAIL.

            We reserve the right to reject any or all tenders of options that we
determine are not in appropriate form or that we determine are unlawful to
accept. Otherwise, we expect to accept all properly and timely tendered eligible
options which are not validly withdrawn. (Section 3.)

Q15.  DURING WHAT PERIOD OF TIME MAY I WITHDRAW PREVIOUSLY TENDERED ELIGIBLE
OPTIONS?

            You may withdraw your tendered eligible options at any time before
the expiration date, which is 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time, on February 21,
2002 (unless the offer is extended). If we extend this offer beyond that time,
you may withdraw your tendered eligible options at any time until the extended
expiration date of this offer. In addition, unless we accept your tendered
eligible options for exchange before 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time, on March
21, 2002, you may withdraw your tendered options at any time after March 21,
2002.

            You must withdraw all tendered eligible options; you may not
withdraw only a portion of tendered eligible options. If you request to withdraw
only a portion of tendered eligible options, your withdrawal will be rejected.

                                       7

<PAGE>

            To withdraw tendered eligible options, we must receive the
withdrawal letter (using the form attached as Exhibit 2 to the end of this
document), or a facsimile thereof, properly completed and signed, while you
still have the right to withdraw the tendered eligible options. As in the case
of delivery of the acceptance letter, you may deliver the signed withdrawal
letter to us at the address noted above by facsimile, inter-office mail, courier
or regular external mail. THE DELIVERY OF ALL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING WITHDRAWAL
LETTERS, IS AT YOUR RISK. WE URGE YOU TO SEND SUCH DOCUMENTS BY FACSIMILE,
COURIER OR REGISTERED MAIL.

            Once you have withdrawn tendered eligible options, you may re-tender
eligible options by the expiration date, and only by again following the
delivery procedures described above in question and answer 14. (Section 4.)

Q16. IF I CHOOSE NOT TO TENDER MY ELIGIBLE OPTIONS FOR EXCHANGE, WHAT DO I HAVE
TO DO?

            Nothing.  You do not have to file or deliver any forms or letters
if you choose to keep your eligible options and not participate in the
offer.  (Section 3.)

Q17.  HOW WILL I KNOW IF 724 SOLUTIONS HAS RECEIVED MY SIGNATURE PAGE ELECTING
TO TENDER MY ELIGIBLE OPTIONS?

            After the expiration date of the offer, we will advise you whether
or not your tender was accepted. We currently expect to accept and cancel
eligible options by February 28, 2002. We expect that notice of your eligible
options that have been tendered and cancelled in the offer will be sent to you
at that time. (Section 5.)

Q18.  HOW SHOULD I DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO PARTICIPATE?

            We understand that this will be an important decision for all
eligible employees. Tendering eligible options in the offer does carry risk, as
there is no guarantee or assurance as to our future share price performance and
we will not immediately grant you the new options. The decision to participate
must be your personal decision, and will depend largely on your assessment of
your existing stock option holdings, and your assumptions about the future
overall economic environment, performance of our business, the stock market
generally and our share price, including your assumptions about the share price
on the anticipated grant date of the new options, which will be the exercise
price of the new options, and our share price thereafter.

            You must make your own decision whether to tender your eligible
options based on your particular circumstances, including the perceived relative
financial and business terms of your eligible options that would be cancelled as
compared to the terms of the new option grant and related tax considerations.
You are reminded that even though you may be an eligible employee and entitled
to tender eligible options for exchange, because of a change in your employment
status, in the event of a merger, sale, takeover, change of control transaction
or similar transaction involving our company, or if we are prohibited by
applicable law or regulation from granting new options, and in certain other
cases, after your eligible options have been tendered and cancelled and before
the related new options have been granted to you, you may lose the right to
receive new options. See question and answer 20 and Section 5.

IMPORTANT MATTERS TO CONSIDER
- -----------------------------

Q19.  WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER THAT COULD TERMINATE THE OFFER IF
THEY OCCUR?

            The offer is subject to a number of conditions with regard to events
that could occur prior to the expiration of the offer. We do not currently
anticipate that any of these events will occur, and we anticipate that the offer
will expire on February 21, 2002, unless extended. These events include, among
other things, a change in financial accounting principles applicable to us, a
legal challenge to the offer or a third-party tender offer for our common shares
or other acquisition proposal. These and various other conditions are more fully
described in Section 6. Once the offer has expired and the tendered options have
been accepted and cancelled in the offer, and except as described in Section 5,
the conditions will no longer apply, even if the specified events occur during
the period between the expiration date and the date of grant of the new options.

Q20. WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO CAUSE ME TO LOSE MY RIGHT TO NEW OPTIONS AFTER MY
ELIGIBLE OPTIONS ARE TENDERED AND CANCELLED?

            The offer is currently scheduled to expire on February 21, 2002. As
promptly as practicable following the expiration date, we expect to accept for
exchange and cancel eligible options properly tendered and not validly withdrawn
before the expiration date. We will grant new options on the day that is six
months and one day after the date of cancellation, subject to the terms and
conditions of this offer.

            In the following circumstances, you can lose the right to new
options after your eligible options have been tendered and cancelled:

            -    You must be continuously employed by 724 Solutions or one of
                 its subsidiaries from the date you tender eligible options
                 for exchange until and including the date of grant of the
                 new options, and you must be principally resident on the
                 date of grant of the new options in one of the permitted
                 jurisdictions listed in question and answer 4 above. If you
                 are not, you will not receive a grant of new options or any
                 other consideration or payment for such tendered and
                 cancelled eligible options.

            -    If after the expiration date of the offer and prior to the
                 new option grant date:

- -    you receive a notice of involuntary termination (including, without
     limitation, redundancy) from 724 Solutions or one of its subsidiaries; or

- -    you resign from or give notice of resignation to 724 Solutions or one of
     its subsidiaries; or

- -    you elect to retire or you enter into an agreement
     with 724 Solutions or one of its subsidiaries to retire; or

- -    your employment with 724 Solutions or one of its subsidiaries ceases as a
     direct result of a business transaction (either through a sale, corporate
     spin-off, joint venture or similar business transaction) or the outsourcing
     of your position; or

<PAGE>


                 you will not receive a grant of new options or any other
                 consideration or payment for such tendered and cancelled
                 eligible options unless at the time of the new option grant
                 date you continue to be an employee of 724 Solutions or one
                 of its subsidiaries, in respect of which none of these
                 events has occurred.

            -    In the event of your death after your eligible options are
                 cancelled in the offer and before the new option grant date,
                 you and your estate will not receive a grant of new options
                 or any other consideration or payment for such tendered and
                 cancelled eligible options.

            In addition, if any of the following events relating to us occurs,
you will not receive any new options in exchange for your tendered eligible
options that have been accepted and cancelled in the exchange, and you will also
not receive any other consideration or payment for the options tendered and
cancelled:

            -    We reserve the right, in the event of a merger, sale,
                 takeover, change of control transaction or similar
                 transaction involving our company on or before the new
                 option grant date, to take any actions that we deem
                 necessary or appropriate to complete a transaction that our
                 board of directors believes is in the best interests of our
                 company and our shareholders. This could include terminating
                 your right to receive new options under this offer to
                 exchange.

            -    We will not issue new options to you if we are prohibited by
                 applicable law or regulations from doing so. We will use
                 reasonable efforts to avoid such a prohibition, but if a
                 prohibition is applicable at the time we would otherwise
                 have granted new options under the offer, you will not be
                 granted new options.

            -    If after the cancellation of tendered eligible options there
                 is a change, development, clarification or position taken in
                 generally accepted accounting principles which could or
                 would require us for financial reporting purposes to record
                 compensation expense against our earnings in connection with
                 the offer or the grant of the new options, you will not be
                 granted new options.

            Finally, we note that we reserve the right to grant new options
earlier than the day that is six months and one day after the date of
cancellation, if we determine that it is in the best interests of 724 Solutions
and our shareholders to do so. In such event, we will notify eligible employees,
which may be by press release, of the earlier new option grant date. (Section
5.)

GENERAL QUESTIONS AND OTHER INFORMATION
- ---------------------------------------

Q21. IF MY CURRENT OPTIONS ARE INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS FOR U.S. TAX PURPOSES,
WILL MY NEW OPTIONS BE INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS?

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.

            If you are a United States employee whose current options are
incentive stock options, your new options will be granted as incentive stock
options (an "incentive stock option") to the extent they qualify within the
meaning of Section 422 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the
"Code"). For your new options to qualify as incentive stock options, the
aggregate exercise price of the new options may not exceed $100,000 (such amount
must take into consideration any other non-tendered incentive stock options that
become exercisable in the same year you are granted the new options).

            If you choose not to tender your eligible options for exchange (or
if we do not accept tendered options for exchange, or you withdraw your tender
of options on or prior to the expiration date of the offer), your eligible
options will remain outstanding and retain their current exercise prices.
However, if the options which you do not tender are vested incentive stock
options, a portion of your options may cease to qualify as incentive stock
options. This is because any vested incentive stock options that are not
tendered will be treated as becoming newly granted and exercisable as of the
date of the offer, and therefore subject to the $100,000 limitation. In
addition, your incentive stock options will be subject to new holding periods in
order to attain long-term capital gain or loss treatment. As a result, you will
have to hold stock for more than two years from the date of the offer and more
than one year from the date on which the shares are issued to you upon exercise
of the incentive stock option in order for any gain or loss on a disposition of
such stock to be deemed long term capital gain or loss. United States employees
should carefully review the description of "Material United States Federal
Income Tax Consequences" that we are providing to you, which contains material
information regarding incentive stock options and other important United States
tax-related issues.

Q22. IF I CHOOSE TO TENDER ELIGIBLE OPTIONS FOR EXCHANGE, DO I HAVE TO TENDER
ALL OF MY ELIGIBLE OPTIONS?

            Yes, you must tender all of your eligible options for exchange if
you want to participate in this offer. If you attempt to tender some of your
eligible options but do not include all of your eligible options, your entire
tender will be rejected. (Section 3.)

Q23.  WHY DON'T WE SIMPLY REPRICE THE CURRENT OPTIONS?

            Repricing outstanding options could, under the financial accounting
rules applicable to us, require us to recognize significant charges in our
financial statements that would reduce our reported earnings for each fiscal
quarter that the repriced options remained outstanding. This could have a
negative impact on our stock price performance. In addition, repricing
outstanding options would not be advantageous for our employees for taxation
purposes in certain jurisdictions. (Section 11.)

                                      11

<PAGE>

Q24. WHY WON'T I RECEIVE MY NEW OPTIONS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXPIRATION DATE OF
THE OFFER?

            If we were to grant the new options sooner than at least six months
and one day after we cancel tendered eligible options, and the new options had
an exercise price that was lower than the exercise price of the cancelled
eligible options, we could be required under the applicable financial accounting
rules to recognize significant charges in our financial statements, which would
reduce our reported earnings for each fiscal quarter that the new options
remained outstanding. This could have a negative impact on our stock price
performance. (Section 11.)

Q25. WHY CAN'T I JUST BE GRANTED MORE OPTIONS WITHOUT HAVING MY ELIGIBLE OPTIONS
CANCELLED?

            Our shareholders have allowed us a limited number of options
available for grant to our employees. The grant of additional options, without
the cancellation of at least some of the outstanding eligible options, would
reduce the number of options that are currently available for grant to our
employees under the 2000 Plan. Because the outstanding eligible options are
"underwater" (i.e., the exercise prices of such options are greater than the
current market prices for our common shares), we have determined that it is in
the best interests of 724 Solutions and our shareholders (including our employee
shareholders) to offer this exchange program as designed. (Section 8.)

Q26. WHAT HAPPENS TO ELIGIBLE OPTIONS THAT I TENDER AND ARE ACCEPTED FOR
EXCHANGE?

            Tendered eligible options that we accept for exchange and acquire in
this offer will be cancelled. Cancelled eligible options will be available for
future option grants (including in the offer) under the 2000 Plan, except for
cancelled eligible options granted under the 1997 Plan and certain of the
eligible options granted under the Tantau Plan. Options available for future
option grants will be available for grants to eligible plan participants without
further shareholder action, except as may be required by applicable law or the
rules of any stock exchange on which our common shares are then quoted or
listed. (Sections 5 and 11.)

Q27.  WILL I HAVE TO PAY TAXES IF I EXCHANGE MY ELIGIBLE OPTIONS IN THE OFFER?

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.

            If you exchange your eligible options for new options, you should
not be required under current law to recognize income for United States Federal
or Canadian income tax purposes at the time of the exchange. Further, at the
date of grant of the new options, we believe that you will not be required under
current law to recognize income for United States Federal or Canadian income tax
purposes. We are providing you, with this offer, a summary of the material
aspects of the difference or additional tax rules that may apply to the new
options in your country.

                                      12

<PAGE>

Q28. WILL I BE REQUIRED TO GIVE UP ALL MY RIGHTS TO ELIGIBLE OPTIONS THAT ARE
CANCELLED IN THE OFFER?

            Yes. Once we have accepted your tendered eligible options after the
expiration of the period during which they can be withdrawn, these eligible
options will be cancelled and you will no longer have any rights with respect to
those eligible options. (Section 8.)

Q29. WILL I BE CONSIDERED FOR ADDITIONAL OPTION GRANTS BEFORE THE GRANT DATE OF
THE NEW OPTIONS? IF I HAVE ELIGIBLE OPTIONS AND DO NOT PARTICIPATE, WHEN SHOULD
I EXPECT TO RECEIVE MY NEXT OPTION GRANT?

            The focus of the option program for the remainder of 2002 is to
provide eligible employees with an opportunity to share in the rebuilding of 724
Solutions, allowing them to potentially realize value from their stock options.
At this time, we do NOT intend to grant additional options (other than the new
options contemplated by this offer) to employees eligible for the offer until
January 2003, except in extraordinary circumstances. This would apply to both
employees who choose to tender their eligible options, and those who do not.
(Section 11.)

Q30.  WHY AREN'T EMPLOYEES IN ALL COUNTRIES ELIGIBLE FOR THIS OFFER?

            We have employees in several jurisdictions who hold eligible
options, and each of these jurisdictions has its own legal and regulatory
requirements that must be considered and satisfied to make the offer. To be able
to make the offer as quickly as possible while complying with applicable legal
and regulatory requirements, we limited the offer to those jurisdictions in
which most of our employees who hold eligible options are located and in which
we are able to readily comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Employees located in those jurisdictions where we are not making this offer will
receive additional information from us regarding other awards. See Section 10
for a description of certain other options that we have issued or may issue in
connection with this offer.

Q31. WHAT HAPPENS TO ANY CURRENT OPTIONS GRANTED TO ME UNDER THE OPTION PLANS
THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE OPTIONS?

            The offer will have no effect on those options that are not eligible
options. Those options will remain outstanding in accordance with, and subject
to, their current terms. However, as noted in question and answer 21, our making
of this offer may change the status of outstanding options intended to qualify
as incentive stock options under the U.S. tax laws. (Section 8.)

Q32. WHAT HAPPENS TO MY ELIGIBLE OPTIONS IF I CHOOSE NOT TO TENDER OR IF 724
SOLUTIONS DOES NOT ACCEPT MY TENDERED ELIGIBLE OPTIONS FOR EXCHANGE?

            Except as noted below, if you choose not to tender all of your
eligible options for exchange or if we do not accept tendered eligible options
for exchange, your eligible options will remain outstanding and retain their
current exercise prices and other current terms. However, as noted in question
and answer 21, our making of this offer may change the status of outstanding
options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. tax laws.
(Section 3.)

                                      13

<PAGE>

Q33. AFTER THE GRANT OF MY NEW OPTIONS, WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MARKET PRICE OF 724
SOLUTIONS' COMMON SHARES DECREASES TO A PRICE THAT IS LESS THAN THE EXERCISE
PRICE FOR THOSE NEW OPTIONS?

            724 Solutions is not providing and is not in a position to provide
any assurances or predictions as to the market price of our common shares at any
time in the future, or the steps we could or might take in the future in such a
situation. We are making this offer only at this time and due to the unusual
stock market conditions that have affected many companies in our industry. This
is a unique offer and you should take this into account in deciding whether to
participate and tender your eligible options. (Section 7.)

Q34. CAN I CONTINUE TO EXERCISE MY VESTED ELIGIBLE OPTIONS BETWEEN JANUARY 24,
2002 AND THE DATE TENDERED ELIGIBLE OPTIONS ARE CANCELLED)?

            You can exercise vested options, including vested eligible options,
during this period. However, eligible options that you exercise during this
period will, once they are exercised, no longer be outstanding and may not be
tendered in the offer. Once you tender eligible options, you cannot exercise
them. To exercise them, you would have to formally withdraw them first in the
manner and at the times permitted under the offer. See question and answer 15.

Q35.  WHO CAN I TALK TO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFER?

recommendations), you should contact:

                                    THE OFFER

1.  ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND ELIGIBLE OPTIONS; EXPIRATION DATE.

            Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the offer, as
described in this offer to exchange, 724 Solutions Inc. is offering to grant new
options under the 2000 Plan in exchange for "eligible options", as defined
below, that are properly tendered by "eligible employees", as defined below, in
accordance with Section 3 (and not validly withdrawn) before the "expiration
date", as defined below, and cancelled in the offer. We will not accept partial
tenders of eligible options. Therefore, if you choose to participate, you must
tender all of your eligible options.

            "Eligible employees" are all employees of 724 Solutions or one of
its subsidiaries who are employed by 724 Solutions or one of its subsidiaries on
January 24, 2002 and on the date the offer expires and who principally reside in
Canada (other than in the Province of Quebec), the United States, the United
Kingdom (other than Scotland) or Germany. However, in the case of an employee
who is an expatriate (i.e., an employee who is on an approved international
assignment) or who is transferred to another location in the course of
employment, "eligible employees" include only those employees who on both
January 24, 2002 and on the date the offer expires are principally resident in a
permitted jurisdiction listed in this paragraph. Also, an employee will not be
considered an "eligible employee" and, accordingly, will not be eligible to
participate in this offer if, on or before the date the offer expires, such
employee:

            -    receives a notice of involuntary termination (including,
                 without limitation, redundancy) from 724 Solutions or one of
                 its subsidiaries;

            -    resigns or gives notice of resignation from such employment;

            -    retires or elects to retire from such employment;

            -    enters into an agreement with 724 Solutions or one of its
                 subsidiaries with respect to such employee's resignation or
                 retirement; or

            -    otherwise ceases to be an "eligible individual" for purposes
                 of the 2000 Plan,

unless on the expiration date the employee is an employee of 724 Solutions or
one of its subsidiaries, in respect of which none of these events has occurred.

            In addition, members of 724 Solutions' board of directors and
executive officers, and other selected senior employees of 724 Solutions and
its subsidiaries who will be separately notified on the date hereof by 724
Solutions of their ineligibility, are not eligible to participate in this
offer. See Section 10 for a description of certain other options that we have
issued or may issue in connection with this offer.

            "Eligible options" are all currently outstanding options to
purchase common shares having an exercise price of greater than U.S.$3.00 if
the exercise price is denominated in United States currency and Cdn.$4.75 if
denominated in Canadian currency, that were granted under the 1997 Plan, the
Tantau Plan, or the 2000 Plan. In the case of the Tantau Plan, only options
granted after January 15, 2001 are eligible options. Any other options to
purchase common shares granted by 724 Solutions, including options granted
under the 724 Solutions Inc. Ezlogin Stock Option Plan, are not eligible
options under the offer. We estimate that options to purchase approximately
1.8 million of

                                      15

<PAGE>

our common shares may be tendered and cancelled in this offer. You will
receive by mail, shortly after the date of this offer, a personalized
statement as to the details of your eligible options.

            If all of your eligible options are properly tendered and cancelled
in the offer and you become entitled to receive new options, the number of
common shares subject to the new options will be equal to the number of common
shares subject to the eligible options that are accepted for exchange and
cancelled (regardless of the extent to which such cancelled options have
vested), subject to adjustments for any future stock splits, certain stock
dividends and similar events in accordance with the terms of the 2000 Plan. Each
new option will entitle the eligible employee to purchase common shares in
accordance with the terms of the 2000 Plan and the applicable stock option
agreement, as described in this offer.

            The exercise price of the new options will be the market price of
our common shares, determined by reference to their closing sale price on The
Toronto Stock Exchange (for employees resident in Canada) and on the NASDAQ
National Market (for employees resident outside of Canada) on the last trading
day immediately preceding the new option grant date. For new options intended to
be incentive stock options, the exercise price will be no less than 110% of the
fair market value of the common shares on the date of grant pursuant to the 2000
Plan if the eligible employee owning such new option has more than 10% of the
voting power of all classes of shares of 724 Solutions or any parent or
subsidiary, as defined in the 2000 Plan.

            The term "expiration date" means 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time,
on February 21, 2002, unless and until we, in our discretion, have extended the
period of time during which this offer will remain open, in which event the term
"expiration date" refers to the latest time and date at which this offer, as so
extended, expires. See Section 13 for a description of our rights to extend,
delay, terminate and amend the offer.

            For purposes of this offer, a "business day" means any day other
than a Saturday, Sunday or United States Federal holiday and consists of the
time period from 12:01 a.m. through 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time.

2.  PURPOSE OF THE OFFER.

            We granted the eligible options outstanding under our option plans
primarily for the following purposes:

            -    to provide our employees an opportunity to acquire or
                 increase a proprietary interest in us, thereby allowing us
                 to attract and motivate our employees and create a stronger
                 incentive for our employees to expend maximum effort for our
                 growth and success; and

            -    to encourage our employees to continue their employment with
                 us.

            Many of our outstanding options have exercise prices that are
significantly higher than the current market price of our common shares. We
understand that, for our stock option plans to provide the intended retention
and performance incentives for our employees, employees must feel that our
options provide them with an opportunity to realize value within a reasonable
period of time. With the uncertainty of current market conditions, particularly
the declining market prices for our common shares during the past several
months, we believe that employees may feel that the

                                      16

<PAGE>

opportunity for realizing value is limited with their existing options. By
making this offer to exchange eligible options for new options that will (1)
have exercise prices determined as described in this offer and (2) vest in
accordance with the vesting schedule described in this offer, we hope to
restore our employees' confidence in their potential ability to realize value
in connection with their employment with us, thereby encouraging them to
remain with us. We believe that these steps will help maximize shareholder
value.

            Neither we nor our board of directors makes any recommendation as to
whether you should tender your eligible options, nor have we authorized any
person to make any such recommendation. Note that the new options may have a
higher exercise price than some or all of your eligible options. The new options
may also have an exercise price that is lower than the exercise price of some or
all of your eligible options. The exercise price may be higher or lower than the
prices at which our common shares have recently traded. You are urged to
evaluate carefully all of the information in this offer and to consult your own
investment and tax advisors. You must make your own decision whether to tender
your eligible options for exchange.

3.  PROCEDURES FOR TENDERING ELIGIBLE OPTIONS.

PROPER TENDER OF ELIGIBLE OPTIONS.

            To validly tender your eligible options pursuant to this offer, you
must, by the expiration date, in accordance with the terms of the acceptance
letter attached at the end of this document as Exhibit 1, properly complete,
sign and deliver to us the signature page to the acceptance letter (using the
attached form), or a facsimile thereof. Except as described in the following
sentence, the acceptance letter must be signed by the eligible employee who is
tendering the eligible options and whose name appears on the instrument or
instruments of grant evidencing such eligible options. If the signature is by a
trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a
corporation or another person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
the signer's full title and proper evidence of the authority of such person to
act in such capacity must be indicated on the acceptance letter.

            We will only accept delivery of your signature page to the
acceptance letter by facsimile, inter-office mail, courier or regular external
mail. We CANNOT accept delivery by e-mail. We must receive your completed and
signed signature page at the following address or fax number: 724 Solutions
Inc., Attention Calvin Barrett, 10 York Mills Road, 3rd Floor, Toronto, Ontario,

DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE AND WITHDRAWAL LETTERS, IS AT YOUR RISK. WE URGE
YOU TO SEND SUCH DOCUMENTS BY FACSIMILE, COURIER OR REGISTERED MAIL.

DETERMINATION OF VALIDITY; REJECTION OF ELIGIBLE OPTIONS; WAIVER OF DEFECTS; NO
OBLIGATION TO GIVE NOTICE OF DEFECTS.

            We will determine, in our discretion, all questions as to form of
documents and the validity, form, eligibility, including time of receipt, and
acceptance of any tender of eligible options. Our determination of these matters
will be final and binding. We may reject any or all tenders of eligible options
that we determine are not in appropriate form or that we determine are unlawful
to accept. Otherwise, we expect to accept all properly and timely tendered
eligible options which are not validly withdrawn. We may also waive any of the
conditions of this offer or any defect or irregularity in any tender with
respect to any particular eligible options or any particular eligible

                                      17

<PAGE>

employee. No tender of eligible options will be deemed to have been properly
made until all defects or irregularities have been cured by the tendering
eligible employee or waived by us. Neither we nor any other person is
obligated to give notice of any defects or irregularities in tenders, and no
one will be liable for failing to give notice of any defects or
irregularities.

OUR ACCEPTANCE CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT.

            Your tender of eligible options pursuant to the procedures described
above constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this offer and
will be controlling, absolute and final, subject to your withdrawal rights under
Section 4 below and our acceptance of your tendered eligible options in
accordance with Section 5 below. Our acceptance of your eligible options
tendered by you pursuant to this offer will constitute a binding agreement
between us and you upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this offer.

            IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO TENDER ANY OPTIONS, YOU DO NOT NEED TO TAKE
ANY ACTION.

4.  WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS.

            You may only withdraw your tendered eligible options in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 4.

            You may withdraw your tendered eligible options at any time before
the expiration date which is February 21, 2002 unless the offer is extended. You
must withdraw all tendered eligible options; you may not withdraw only a portion
of tendered eligible options. If you propose to withdraw only a portion of
tendered eligible options, your withdrawal will be rejected.

            If the offer is extended by us beyond that time, you may withdraw
your tendered eligible options at any time until the extended expiration of the
offer. In addition, unless we accept your tendered eligible options for exchange
before 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time, on March 21, 2002, you may withdraw
your tendered options at any time after March 21, 2002.

            To validly withdraw tendered eligible options, we must receive, at
the address set forth in Section 3, the withdrawal letter (using the form
attached to the end of this document as Exhibit 2), or a facsimile thereof,
signed by you, while you still have the right to withdraw the tendered eligible
options. The withdrawal letter must specify the name of the eligible employee
who tendered the eligible options to be withdrawn. Except as described in the
following sentence, the withdrawal letter must be signed by the eligible
employee who tendered the eligible options to be withdrawn and whose name
appears on the instrument or instruments of grant evidencing such eligible
options. If the signature is by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian,
attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation or another person acting in a
fiduciary or representative capacity, the signer's full title and proper
evidence of the authority of such person to act in such capacity must be
indicated on the notice of withdrawal.

            You may not rescind any withdrawal, and eligible options you
withdraw will thereafter be deemed not properly tendered for purposes of the
offer, unless you properly re-tender your eligible options before the expiration
date by following the procedures described in Section 3.

                                      18

<PAGE>

            Neither we nor any other person is obligated to give notice of any
defects or irregularities in any withdrawal letter, nor will anyone incur any
liability for failure to give any such notice. We will determine all questions
as to the form and validity, including time of receipt, of withdrawal letters.
Our determination of these matters will be final and binding.

5. ACCEPTANCE OF ELIGIBLE OPTIONS FOR EXCHANGE AND ISSUANCE OF NEW OPTIONS.

            Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this offer and as
promptly as practicable following the expiration date, we expect to accept for
exchange and cancel eligible options properly tendered and not validly withdrawn
and to notify all eligible employees who have tendered their eligible options of
our acceptance. For purposes of this offer, we will be deemed to have accepted
for exchange eligible options that are validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn, if and when we give written notice to eligible employees of our
acceptance for exchange of such eligible options, which may be by press release.
Promptly after we accept tendered eligible options for exchange, we will send
each tendering eligible employee a notice indicating the number of eligible
options that we have accepted for exchange, the corresponding number of new
options and the approximate date upon which we expect to grant the new options.

            Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this offer, we
currently expect that we will, by February 28, 2002, accept for exchange and
cancel eligible options properly tendered and not validly withdrawn before the
expiration date and to notify all eligible employees who have tendered their
eligible options of our acceptance. We then expect to grant new options on the
day that is six months and one day after the date of cancellation (subject to
our right to grant new options earlier, as described below). If on February 28,
2002 we cancel eligible options accepted for exchange, you will be granted new
options on August 29, 2002, subject to the conditions described below. If the
offer is extended, then the grant date of the new options will also be extended
if necessary to ensure that the new option grant date is at least six months and
one day following the date eligible options are cancelled.

            However, we reserve the right to grant new options earlier than the
day that is six months and one day after the date of cancellation, if we
determine that it is in the best interests of 724 Solutions and its shareholders
to do so. In such event, we will notify eligible employees, which may be by
press release, of the earlier new option grant date. The exercise price and
other terms of such new options shall be determined as otherwise provided by the
terms of this offer.

            To be entitled to the new options after your tendered eligible
options have been cancelled in the offer, you must meet all of the following
conditions:

            You must be continuously employed by 724 Solutions or one of
its subsidiaries from the date you tender eligible options for exchange to and
on the date of grant of the new options, and on the date of grant of the new
options you must be principally resident in one of the permitted jurisdictions
listed in Section 1 above; and

            Prior to the new option grant date, you must NOT have:

            -    received a notice of involuntary termination (including,
                 without limitation, redundancy) from 724 Solutions or one of
                 its subsidiaries;

            -    resigned or given notice of resignation from such employment;

                                      19

<PAGE>

            -    retired or elected to retire from such employment;

            -    entered into an agreement with 724 Solutions or one of its
                 subsidiaries with respect to your resignation or retirement;

            -    ceased to be employed with 724 Solutions or one of its
                 subsidiaries as a direct result of a business transaction
                 (either through a sale, corporate spin-off, joint venture or
                 similar business transaction) or the outsourcing of your
                 position; or

            -    otherwise ceased to be an "eligible individual" for purposes
                 of the 2000 Plan,

            unless on the new option grant date you are an employee of 724
            Solutions or one of its subsidiaries in respect of which none of
            these events has occurred.

            If you do not meet all of the conditions listed above, you will not
receive any new options in exchange for your tendered eligible options that have
been accepted and cancelled in the exchange. You will also not receive any other
consideration or payment under such circumstances for the options tendered.
Please note that the foregoing will apply regardless of whether or not you
receive severance in connection with such a change in your employment status,
and any such loss of tendered and cancelled eligible options will not be
considered with respect to any severance you may receive in relation to such a
change in your employment status. In addition, in the event of your death after
your eligible options are cancelled in the offer and before the new option grant
date, you and your estate will not receive a grant of new options or any other
consideration or payment for such tendered and cancelled eligible options.

            In addition, we reserve the right, in the event of a merger, sale,
takeover, change of control transaction or similar transaction, to take any
actions that we deem necessary or appropriate to complete a transaction that our
board of directors believes is in the best interests of our company and our
shareholders. This could include terminating your right to receive new options
under this offer to exchange. If we were to terminate your right to receive new
options under this offer in connection with such a transaction, employees who
have tendered eligible options for cancellation in this offer would not receive
new options, options to purchase securities of an acquiror or any other
consideration for their tendered options.

            Furthermore, in the event that after the cancellation of tendered
eligible options there is a change, development, clarification or position taken
in generally accepted accounting principles which could or would require us for
financial reporting purposes to record compensation expense against our earnings
in connection with the offer or the grant of the new options, you will not be
granted new options or any other consideration or other payment for such
tendered and cancelled eligible options.

            We will also not issue new options to you if it is prohibited by
applicable law or regulations from doing so. We will use reasonable efforts to
avoid being subject to such a prohibition, but if such a prohibition is
applicable at the time we would otherwise have granted new options under the
offer, you will not be granted new options.

                                      20

          Solutions or our subsidiaries, or otherwise materially impair in any

          consent, approval, exemption or exemption order required to be
          obtained from any government or governmental, regulatory or
          administrative agency, authority or tribunal is not obtained, is
          withdrawn or is subject to conditions, in any such case that, in our
          reasonable judgment, would or might directly or indirectly:

          (1)  make the acceptance for exchange of, or issuance of new options
               for, some or all of the tendered eligible options illegal or
               otherwise restrict or prohibit consummation of the offer or

          (3)  materially impair the benefits that we believe we will receive
               from the offer;

          (4)  require that we obtain shareholder approval of the offer; or

          (5)  materially and adversely affect the business, condition
               (financial or other), income, operations or prospects of us or
               our subsidiaries, or otherwise materially impair in any way the
               contemplated future conduct of our business or the business of
               any of our subsidiaries;

                                      21

<PAGE>

     (c)  any change, development, clarification or position taken in generally
          accepted accounting principles which could or would require us for
          financial reporting purposes to record compensation expense against
          our earnings in connection with the offer or the grant of the new
          options;

     (d)  any change, development, clarification or position taken in generally
          accepted accounting principles which could or would enable us to
          achieve some or all of the goals of this offer by taking other actions
          with respect to some or all of the eligible options in a manner that
          would not require us for financial reporting purposes to record
          compensation expense against our earnings in connection with such
          actions, or that would otherwise have favorable or beneficial
          accounting treatment for us;

     (e)  a tender or exchange offer with respect to some or all of our common

          subsidiaries or materially impairs or impacts or may materially impair
          or impact the benefits that we believe we will receive from the offer.

            These conditions are for our benefit. We may assert them in our
discretion regardless of the circumstances giving rise to them prior to the
expiration date. We may waive them, in whole or in part, at any time and from
time to time prior to the expiration date, in our discretion, whether or not we
waive any other condition to the offer. Our failure at any time to exercise any
of these rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such rights. The waiver of
any of these rights with respect to particular facts and circumstances is not a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances. Any determination we
make concerning the events described in this Section 6 will be final and
binding.

            As of January 23, 2002, the last reported sale price of our common
shares as reported on The Toronto Stock Exchange was Cdn.$3.45 per share and as
quoted on the NASDAQ National Market was U.S.$2.18 per share. We recommend that
you obtain current market quotations for our common shares before deciding
whether to tender your eligible options.

8. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION; TERMS OF NEW OPTIONS.

CONSIDERATION

            We will issue new options to purchase our common shares under the
2000 Plan in exchange for eligible options properly tendered and cancelled in
the offer by us, subject to the terms set forth in the offer.

            If all of your eligible options are properly tendered and cancelled
in the offer and you become entitled to receive new options, the number of
common shares subject to the new options will be equal to the number of common
shares subject to the eligible options that are accepted for exchange and
cancelled (regardless of the extent to which the tendered options have vested),
subject to adjustments for any future stock splits, certain stock dividends and
similar events in accordance with the terms of the 2000 Plan. Each new option
will entitle the eligible employee to purchase common shares in accordance with
the terms of the 2000 Plan and the applicable stock option agreement.

            As of January 23, 2002, approximately 6.4 million options were
issued and outstanding under the option plans. The approximately 1.8 million
eligible options that we are offering to exchange represent approximately 28% of
all options outstanding under the option plans as of January 23, 2002.

            If we receive and accept tenders of all eligible options, we expect
to grant a total of approximately 1.8 million new options under the 2000 Plan,
assuming all eligible employees who have tendered their eligible options are
entitled to a grant of new options under the 2000 Plan. Members of our board of
directors and officers, and the other selected senior employees of 724 Solutions
and its subsidiaries who will be separately notified by 724 Solutions of their
ineligibility, are not eligible to participate in this offer. See Section 10 for
a description of certain other options that we have issued or may issue in
connection with this offer.

GENERAL TERMS OF NEW OPTIONS

            The new options will be issued under the 2000 Plan. We will issue a
new stock option agreement evidencing all new options granted in this offer.
Each recipient of the new options must execute a copy of that agreement in order
to obtain the benefit of the options.

                                      23

<PAGE>

            The issuance of new options under this offer will not create any
contractual or other right of the recipients to receive any future grants of
stock options or any benefits instead of stock options or any right of continued
employment.

DESCRIPTION OF NEW OPTIONS

            The following description summarizes the material terms of the new
options which are to be granted under the 2000 Plan. Material differences
between the terms and conditions of the eligible options granted under the
option plans and the new options are also discussed below. The terms described
below of eligible options originally issued under the 1997 Plan or the Tantau
Plan that are accepted and cancelled in this offer will not apply to the new
options to be granted under the 2000 Plan.

            The following description of the 2000 Plan and the new options,
along with any description of the eligible options granted under the option
plans, is only a summary of the material terms thereof, and is qualified in its
entirety by the specific language of the option plans and applicable stock
option agreement, copies of which are available as exhibits to the Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO that we have filed with the SEC or directly from us.

            2000 PLAN

            The primary purpose of the 2000 Plan is to provide incentives to
employees and directors of 724 Solutions and its subsidiaries to acquire a
proprietary interest in 724 Solutions, to continue as employees and directors,
to increase their efforts on behalf of 724 Solutions and to promote the success
of 724 Solutions' business.

            With respect to United States employees, the 2000 Plan provides for
the granting of options to purchase common shares of 724 Solutions in the form
of incentive stock options and options that do not qualify as incentive stock
options, designated as non-qualified stock options.

            PLAN ADMINISTRATION

            The 2000 Plan is administered by our stock option committee (the
"stock option committee"), pursuant to guidelines (the "guidelines")
established by our human resources and compensation committee (the
"compensation committee") established by our board of directors. Members of
these committees are selected by, serve at the discretion of, and may be
removed by, our board of directors. Subject to the terms of the 2000 Plan,
the compensation committee has the authority to construe and interpret the
2000 Plan and to establish and amend rules and regulations for administering
the 2000 Plan. The compensation committee (and the stock option committee,
subject to the guidelines) determines, amongst other things, the eligibility
of individuals to participate in the 2000 Plan and the term, vesting period
and the exercise price of options granted under the 2000 Plan. Under certain
circumstances, as described in the 2000 Plan, the compensation committee may
also amend some of the terms of outstanding options.

            SECURITIES SUBJECT TO 2000 PLAN

            In January 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Tantau
Software, Inc. ("Tantau"), we assumed certain stock options that had been
granted by Tantau to its employees. Under the rules of

                                      24

<PAGE>

The Toronto Stock Exchange, a portion of those options are notionally counted
against the available grant room under the 2000 Plan.

            The maximum number of our common shares available for issuance upon
exercise of options granted under the 2000 Plan, including the 1.5 million
shares relating to Tantau, is currently 10.5 million.

            The 2000 Plan provides that in the event of certain corporate
transactions, as defined below, the compensation committee may make equitable
changes or adjustments to any or all of (i) the number of common shares
available for issuance under the 2000 Plan, and (ii) the number of common
shares issued or issuable in respect of outstanding options granted, provided
that any resulting fractional shares shall be eliminated.

            EXERCISE PRICE

            The exercise price payable for a common share of 724 Solutions
covered by an option under the 2000 Plan is established by the compensation
committee (or by the stock option committee), and with respect to the new
options cannot be less than the market price of the common shares, determined
by reference to the closing sale price on the last trading day immediately
preceding the new option grant date of our common shares on The Toronto Stock
Exchange (for employees resident in Canada) and on the NASDAQ National Market
(for employees resident outside of Canada). The exercise price of incentive
stock options will be no less than the fair market value as determined in
accordance with the 2000 Plan of the common shares on the date of grant, or
110% of the fair market value of the common shares as determined in
accordance with the 2000 Plan in the case of an incentive stock option
granted to an employee having more than 10% of the voting power of all
classes of shares of 724 Solutions or any parent or subsidiary (as defined in
the 2000 Plan). In addition, no optionee may be granted incentive stock
options that together with all other incentive stock options granted to such
optionee, entitle the optionee to purchase in any year through the exercise
of those options that first become exercisable in such year common shares
having in the aggregate a fair market value (determined in the case of each
such option as of the time such option was granted) in excess of
U.S.$100,000. If the conditions set forth in the foregoing sentence are not
complied with, options represented by the common shares in excess of the
U.S.$100,000 limitation shall be treated as non-qualified stock options.

            The exercise price for the new options will be denominated in
Canadian dollars for eligible employees resident in Canada. The exercise price
for the new options will be denominated in United States dollars for eligible
employees resident outside of Canada (including United States residents).

            EXERCISE OF OPTIONS

            An option granted under the 2000 Plan may be exercised by giving
written notice of exercise to 724 Solutions. The option exercise price to
exercise the option for common shares must be paid at the time of exercise in
full in cash or by certified cheque, or subject to the consent of the
compensation committee, in whole common shares with a fair market value at
least equal to the exercise price (or with the consent of the compensation
committee, in another appropriate manner, such as a combination of cash and
whole common shares or by a cashless exercise of options through a
broker-dealer). All such consents in respect of incentive stock options will
be made at the time the incentive stock options are granted.

                                      25

<PAGE>

            TERM

            The term of the new options granted under the 2000 Plan will be set
forth in the applicable stock option agreement, and will commence on the date of
grant of the new options and, subject to the applicable vesting requirements and
the conditions relating to incentive stock options discussed below, will be
exercisable during the period beginning on the effective date of grant of the
new options and ending on the tenth anniversary of the date of such grant.
However, the period for exercise of the new options will end on an earlier date
in the event of the termination of an eligible employee's employment, which is
discussed below. New options intended to qualify as an incentive stock option
will have a term of no longer than five years if the eligible employee, at the
time the new option is granted holds more than 10% of the voting power of all
classes of shares of 724 Solutions or its parent or subsidiary (as defined in
the 2000 Plan).

            TERMINATION

            2000 PLAN. Under the 2000 Plan, an option will expire and terminate
as contemplated by such optionee's option agreement or, if no such provision is
set forth, then immediately upon the optionee who holds such option ceasing to
be an eligible person (as defined in the 2000 Plan). Upon an optionee ceasing to
be an eligible individual (as defined in the 2000 Plan), any eligible investment
vehicle (as defined below) related to such eligible individual shall cease to be
an eligible person. Under the 2000 Plan, the compensation committee, subject to
applicable rules of The Toronto Stock Exchange and other applicable securities
regulators, has the discretion to determine the provisions relating to the
termination of unexercised options in the case of bankruptcy, death, disability,
retirement, termination of employment or directorship of an optionee with 724
Solutions or any affiliate. Any such provisions shall be set forth in the
related option agreement between 724 Solutions and the optionee. Changes to such
terms after grant typically require the consent of The Toronto Stock Exchange.

            The board of directors or the compensation committee may (with the
consent of The Toronto Stock Exchange and other applicable securities
regulators, if required) approve a deferral of the early termination of an
option held by an eligible individual if such individual takes an approved leave
of absence (including sick leave, military leave or any other leave of absence
approved by 724 Solutions management). Such deferral shall not exceed six months
(or 90 days, in the case of an incentive stock option) and the vesting schedule
of the option in question shall be suspended during the term of the leave of
absence. If the individual in question resumes his or her employment or service
relationship with 724 Solutions or an affiliate within such six month (or 90
day) period, then the option shall not be forfeited as a result of the leave of
absence and the vesting schedule shall then resume from the point at which it
was suspended. The board of directors or the compensation committee may impose
such requirements as it deems appropriate in connection with its approval of
such a deferral.

            Generally, options granted under the 2000 Plan will terminate
following termination of your employment, unless the options are exercised,
to the extent that they are exercisable immediately before termination, by
the earlier of 30 days following your termination or the expiry of the
original term of the option. Generally, in the event of termination of your
employment by reason of disability or death, you or your executors,
administrators or legatees of your estate, as the case may be, may exercise
any option held by you at the date of your employment termination (to the
extent that it was exercisable immediately before such termination) within
one year following such termination. An option that is an incentive stock
option which is exercised more than three months after the date on

                                      26

<PAGE>

which an individual ceases to be an employee (other than by reason of death
or permanent and total disability as defined under the Code) will be treated
as a non-qualified stock option to the extent required under the Code.

            1997 PLAN. In the event of termination for cause under the 1997
Plan, the vested portion of any eligible option grant will remain exercisable
for a period of 30 days after the date of termination. If the employment
relationship of a holder of an option granted under the 1997 Plan is terminated
without cause, the vested portion of any grant will remain exercisable until the
expiration date of the option, provided that the optionee complies with certain
provisions under the applicable employment agreement. Unvested options issued
under the 1997 Plan will expire on termination unless the eligible options would
have vested within six months or within the required statutory notice period
following the termination without cause, whichever is earlier, or within one
year if termination is due to death or disability.

            We are entitled, upon the holder of an existing option under the
1997 Plan ceasing to be our employee, to exercise a call right to repurchase all
such options beneficially owned by such optionee at market value, as determined
under the 1997 Plan. Furthermore, options granted under the 1997 Plan may be
terminated by us upon any attempt by an optionee to, directly or indirectly,
transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of such options.

            TANTAU PLAN. Under the Tantau Plan, if a holder of an option
(including an eligible option) ceases to be an employee of 724 Solutions, such
optionee may exercise the option within the period of time specified in the
applicable option agreement (which is generally three months and, pursuant to
the Tantau Plan, can be no less than 30 days) to the extent that the option is
vested on the date of termination. In no event may the option be exercised later
than expiration of the term of the option as set forth in the applicable option
agreement. If no time is specified in the option agreement, the option shall
remain exercisable for 90 days following the optionee's termination.

            Under the Tantau Plan, if an optionee ceases to be an employee as a
result of the optionee's death or disability, the option may be exercised within
the period of time specified in the applicable option agreement (which is
generally one year and, pursuant to the Tantau Plan, can be no less than 180
days) to the extent the option is vested on the date of termination or death, as
the case may be. However, in no event may such exercise take place later than
the expiration of the term of such option as set forth in the option agreement.
In the event of death, the option may be exercised by the optionee's estate or
by a person who acquires the right to exercise the option by bequest or
inheritance. If no time is specified in the option agreement, such option shall
remain exercisable to the extent it is vested on the date of termination for 365
days following the optionee's termination or death, as the case may be.

            If, at the time of termination or death, as the case may be, the
optionee is not vested as to the entire option, the common shares
covered by the unvested portion of the option may not be purchased. In addition,
if the option is not so exercised within the time specified after death or
termination, as the case may be, the option shall terminate, and the common
shares covered by the option may not be purchased.

            EXERCISE AND VESTING

            2000 PLAN. The compensation committee (and the stock option
committee, subject to the guidelines) determines the vesting periods of the
options granted under the 2000 Plan.

                                      27

<PAGE>

            The board of directors or the compensation committee may, in its
discretion (but subject to the consent of any applicable stock exchanges, if
required), subsequent to the grant of an option, permit an optionee to exercise
any or all of the unvested options then outstanding and granted to the optionee
under the 2000 Plan.

            Eligible options granted under the 2000 Plan after November 19, 2000
generally vest at the rate of 25% on each anniversary of the date of grant,
until all such options are exercisable, subject to the other vesting and
termination provisions set forth in the 2000 Plan and applicable option
agreement. Eligible options granted under the 2000 Plan before November 19, 2000
generally vest at the rate of 33 1/3% on each anniversary of the date of grant,
until all such options are exercisable, subject to the other termination
provisions set forth in the plan and applicable option agreement.

            1997 PLAN. Eligible options granted under the 1997 Plan, generally
have a vesting schedule similar to the vesting schedule for options granted
under the 2000 Plan before November 19, 2000.

            TANTAU PLAN. All of the eligible options granted under the Tantau
Plan were granted on January 16, 2001. 25% of the options granted on January 16,
2001 under the Tantau Plan will vest on the second anniversary date of the grant
date, with an additional 25% vesting on each subsequent anniversary date, until
all such options are exercisable, subject to the other vesting and termination
provisions set forth in the plan.

            The terms of the new grants to be made to participating employees in
the offer will provide that 25% of the common shares that may be purchased under
the new options will vest at the time of the grant of the new options, with an
additional 25% of such shares subject to the new options becoming exercisable on
each anniversary date of the grant, subject to the other provisions of the 2000
Plan that would cause such options to vest early or to terminate. Accordingly,
on the third anniversary date of the new grant, all of these new options will be
fully vested. This vesting schedule will replace the vesting schedule of the
eligible options that are cancelled in this offer.

            TRANSFERABILITY

            2000 PLAN. Upon the death of an optionee, options granted under the
2000 Plan may be exercised by the legal representative of the optionee or the
optionee's estate. Under the 2000 Plan, options (other than incentive stock
options) may be transferred or assigned between an eligible employee and his
personal holding company, family trust and certain tax sheltered savings plans
(the "eligible investment vehicle") that meet specified criteria, upon approval
of the compensation committee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
Otherwise, options granted under the 2000 Plan are not transferable.

            1997 PLAN. Under the 1997 Plan, options may only be exercised by the
optionee (or certain trusts and personal holding corporations), and upon the
optionee's death, the legal representative of his or her estate. Options are
non-assignable and, accordingly, an optionee exercising an option may purchase
common shares only in his or her own name, on behalf of such an entity, or in
his or her capacity as a legal representative. Furthermore, we may terminate
eligible options granted under the 1997 Plan upon any attempt by an optionee to,
directly or indirectly, transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise
dispose of such options in a manner that is contrary to the provisions of the
1997 Plan.

                                      28

<PAGE>

            TANTAU PLAN. The eligible options granted under the Tantau Plan may
not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any
manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be
exercised, during the lifetime of the optionee, only by the optionee.

            ADJUSTMENTS UPON CERTAIN EVENTS

            2000 PLAN. Under the 2000 Plan, in the event of (i) a sale or
transfer of all or substantially all of the property or assets of 724 Solutions,
(ii) a transaction contemplated in Subsection 182(1) of the BUSINESS
CORPORATIONS ACT (Ontario), (iii) a merger, consolidation, amalgamation,
reclassification, reorganization or liquidation (a "corporate transaction"), or
(iv) an offer to purchase all or substantially all of the shares of 724
Solutions by a third party, our board of directors may determine the manner in
which all unexercised options may be treated, including acceleration of vesting
and/or the expiration date of all or a portion of such options. Subject to the
foregoing, in the event of a corporate transaction, an option holder (including
holders of a new option) under the 2000 Plan may receive, upon exercise of such
holder's option in accordance with the terms of the 2000 Plan, the aggregate
number of shares of the appropriate class and/or securities of 724 Solutions or
the successor corporation to which such holder would be entitled to receive as a
result of such corporate transaction if such holder had been the registered
holder of the number of common shares subject to the option on the record date
of such transaction.

            With respect to options granted under the 2000 Plan prior to January
23, 2002, in the event of a change of control, as defined below, the option
holder shall be entitled to exercise all of such holder's unexercised options. A
"change of control" generally refers to the acquisition by a person (or a group
of persons acting jointly or in concert) of more than 50% of the voting shares
of 724 Solutions or a consolidation, merger or amalgamation into another
corporation in which the voting shareholders of 724 Solutions prior to such
consolidation, merger or amalgamation receive shares entitled to exercise less
than 50% of the voting rights attaching to the voting shares of the
consolidated, merged or amalgamated corporation, including a sale of all or
substantially all of 724 Solutions' assets to any other corporation.

            Pursuant to an amendment of the 2000 Plan made by the board of
directors on January 23, 2002, with respect to options granted under the 2000
Plan on or after such date, including all new options granted to eligible
employees in connection with the offer, and the option grants to certain
directors, officers and other selected senior personnel and the additional
option grants described in Section 10, in the event of a change of control
(generally, as defined in the paragraph above), the option holder shall be
entitled to exercise all of such holder's unexercised options as of the first
anniversary of the change of control, or earlier in the circumstances described
in the next sentence. Upon a change of control, in the event that a successor to
our company fails to assume and agree to perform our obligations under stock
option agreements made pursuant to the 2000 Plan, or in the event that the
option holder is involuntarily terminated prior to such first anniversary, the
option holder shall be entitled to exercise all of such holder's unexercised
options granted under the 2000 Plan on or after January 23, 2002.
"Involuntarily terminated" means (i) a termination by us of the option holder's
employment with us other than for cause; (ii) a material reduction of or
variation in the option holder's duties, authority or responsibilities,
relative to the option holder's duties, authority or responsibilities as in
effect immediately prior to such reduction or variation; (iii) a reduction by
us or our subsidiary in the base salary of the option holder as in effect
immediately prior to such reduction; (iv) a material reduction by us in the
kind or level of employee benefits, including bonuses, to which the option
holder was entitled immediately prior to such reduction) with the result that
the option holder's overall benefits


                                      29

<PAGE>

package is materially reduced; or (v) the relocation of the option holder to
a facility or a location more than thirty (30) miles from the option holder's
then present location.

            OTHER PLANS. The provisions with respect to adjustments upon
certain events with respect to eligible options under the 1997 Plan and the
Tantau Plan are substantially similar in all material respects to the
provisions set out in the 2000 Plan in effect prior to the amendments made
January 23, 2002 described above.

            AMENDMENTS; TERMINATION

            2000 PLAN. Under the 2000 Plan, our board of directors may amend the
2000 Plan without the consent of the optionholder, provided that: (i) unless the
change is required by a securities commission, stock exchange or other
governmental or regulatory body having jurisdiction over the 2000 Plan, no such
action may materially and adversely affect the rights of an optionholder under
any options then outstanding (including new options) without the consent of such
optionholder; and (ii) if required by applicable law or the rules of any stock
exchange on which the securities of 724 Solutions are listed, shareholder
approval and other regulatory approval of the amended form of the 2000 Plan must
be obtained. Our board of directors or the compensation committee may suspend or
terminate the 2000 Plan or any portion of it at any time, subject to requisite
shareholder or regulatory approval as set forth in this paragraph. Except as
otherwise provided, no such termination or suspension may, without the consent
of an affected optionholder, alter or impair any then outstanding option.

            1997 PLAN.  The provisions with respect to the amendments under the
1997 Plan are similar to the provisions of the 2000 Plan.

            TANTAU PLAN.  Amendments to the Tantau Plan may be made without the
consent of the holder unless the amendment materially or adversely affects
the rights of the holder.

REGISTRATION OF COMMON SHARES

            All of our common shares issuable upon exercise of options under the
option plans, including the shares that will be issuable upon exercise of all
new options to be granted pursuant to the offer, have been or will be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") on a registration
statement on Form S-8 filed with the SEC. Unless you are one of our
"affiliates", as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which group
generally consists of our directors, executive officers and certain significant
shareholders, we anticipate that you will generally be able to sell your common
shares issued upon exercise of new options free of any transfer restrictions
under applicable securities laws in the United States or Canada.

            If an optionee recipient is deemed to be an affiliate of 724
Solutions, any common shares acquired by such person under the 2000 Plan shall
be subject to the volume limitations and other requirements with respect to
sales that are set forth in Rule 144 and the certificate or certificates
representing such shares may bear a legend restricting the transfer thereof.
Such persons may, however, resell the shares so acquired under (i) the volume
limitations of Rule 144, (ii) any other applicable exemption from registration
under the Securities Act, or (iii) a separate prospectus prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the applicable form under the Securities Act. However,
a person that is deemed an affiliate of 724 Solutions solely by virtue of
holding the

                                      30

<PAGE>

position of an officer or director may effect resales over The
Toronto Stock Exchange, subject to the provisions of Rule 904 of Regulation S,
without being subject to the volume limitations and other requirements of Rule
144.

10. INTERESTS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS; TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS
CONCERNING THE OPTIONS AND OUR COMMON SHARES.

            A list of our directors and executive officers is attached to this
offer as Schedule A. As of January 23, 2002, such persons, as a group,
beneficially owned in the aggregate options to purchase approximately 1.4
million of our common shares, which represented approximately 22% of all options
outstanding as of that date. None of our directors or executive officers, and
other selected senior employees of 724 Solutions and its subsidiaries who will
be separately notified by 724 Solutions of their ineligibility, are eligible to
participate in the offer.

            During the sixty days prior to January 24, 2002 we granted to
several employees options to purchase an aggregate of 15,500 of our common
shares. The exercise prices of these options were based upon the fair market
value of our common shares on the date of grant, as determined under the 2000
Plan. During this period, we issued an aggregate of 63,889 of our common shares
upon the exercise of outstanding options held by our employees.

            We currently have a vacancy on our board of directors which we are
seeking to fill. We are considering potential candidates but no final decisions
have been made.

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

            In connection with our January 2001 acquisition of Tantau, we
terminated a registration rights agreement that we previously had with
several of our initial investors, and entered into a new registration rights
agreement. This new registration rights agreement, as described below,
provides certain former shareholders of Tantau with some of the piggy-back
rights that existed in the original agreement. Three groups of our
shareholders have registration rights under this agreement:

            -    our founder, Greg Wolfond, Blue Sky Capital Corporation and
                 1319079 Ontario Inc., who as of November 17, 2001 in the
                 aggregate held approximately 4.7 million common shares;

            -    several of our initial strategic investors, including Bank
                 of America, Bank of Montreal, Citigroup and Sonera, who as
                 of November 17, 2001 in the aggregate held more than 17.8
                 million common shares; and

            -    several former shareholders of Tantau including Austin
                 Ventures and funds managed by J.P. Morgan Partners (BHCA),
                 L.P., who as of November 17, 2001 in the aggregate held
                 approximately 5.9 million common shares.

            Please note that the amounts set forth above are based primarily
upon the filings made by these shareholders under the U.S. securities laws. The
exercise of these registration rights would make a large number of our common
shares available in the public markets, which could cause the market prices of
our shares to decrease.

            Under this agreement, each of these three groups of shareholders
received rights to require us to register their holdings of common shares under
the applicable securities laws of the United States and/or Canada. Our founder,
together with Blue Sky Capital Corporation and 1319079 Ontario Inc., acting as a
group, and our strategic investors, acting as a group, each obtained the right
to demand that we effect such a registration. A demand from either our founder,
Blue Sky Capital Corporation and 1319079 Ontario Inc., on the one hand, or the
strategic investors, on the other hand, will enable the other two groups of
shareholders to include their shares in that registration. In addition, if we
commence the registration of our shares under specified circumstances other than
as a result of a demand under the agreement, each of these three groups of
shareholders will have the right to include their shares in that registration.

            Each of Mr. Wolfond, Blue Sky Capital Corporation and 1319079
Ontario Inc., on the one hand, and the strategic investors, on the other hand,
received the right to demand that we register shares on two separate occasions
per group. A demand registration, together with the other shares included in
that registration under the agreement, must provide for the resale of at least
U.S.$20.0 million of our shares.

            SHORT FORM REGISTRATIONS. Mr. Wolfond, Blue Sky Capital Corporation
and 1319079 Ontario Inc., acting as a group, and the strategic investors, acting
as a group, may require that we file a short-form registration statement to
enable them to resell all or a portion of their shares. These registrations are
unlimited in number, but we cannot be required to effect such a registration if
we have registered shares after a demand under the agreement during the 180 day
period before the new demand. A short-form registration of this kind must cover
common shares amounting to at least U.S.$15.0 million.

                                      34

<PAGE>

            TANTAU SHARES SUBJECT TO RESALE LIMITATIONS. The former shareholders
of Tantau that are parties to the agreement will not be able to require us to
register any shares that are subject to the resale restrictions set forth in the
agreements relating to our acquisition of Tantau.

            TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The registration rights granted
under the agreement will terminate as follows:

            -    in the case of our founder, Blue Sky Capital Corporation and
                 1319079 Ontario Inc., and in the case of our strategic
                 investors:

            -    in January 2004, or

            -    if earlier, the time at which their shares are generally
                 freely tradable under United States and Canadian securities
                 laws, and the aggregate ownership of the relevant
                 shareholder is less than specified minimum amounts; and

            -    in the case of the former shareholders of Tantau:

            -    in January 2004, or

            -    upon the transfer by that shareholder of our common shares
                 to another party, or

            -    if the relevant shareholder holds less than specified
                 minimum amounts.

            PRIORITY IN UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS. If shares are registered under
the agreement in an underwritten offering in which the managing underwriter
advises us that market conditions require us to limit the number of shares that
may be sold in that offering, the agreement provides for an allocation of the
shares to be sold between us, the shareholders that are parties to the
agreement, and any other shareholders that are including shares in that
registration.

            EXPENSES AND INDEMNIFICATION. We are generally required to pay the
expenses of any registration required to be made under the agreement, although
the shareholders will be responsible for the payment of their own brokerage fees
or underwriting expenses in connection with any sale. Under some circumstances,
we will be required to indemnify the shareholders that are parties to the
agreement for any liabilities arising under applicable securities laws in
connection with a registration of their shares.

            ADDITIONAL REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The agreement limits our ability to
grant specified types of registration rights deemed to be superior to, or
greater than, some of the rights provided in the agreement.

OPTION GRANTS TO CERTAIN DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND OTHER SELECTED SENIOR PERSONNEL

            Our directors and officers are not eligible to participate in this
offer, and they will not be asked to surrender or cancel any of their existing
options. In addition, we believe that any equity awards made at this time to
these individuals, as well as to other selected senior employees that we

                                      35

<PAGE>

have identified, should be structured in a manner that is designed to
maximize their incentive to work towards our becoming profitable.

            On January 23, 2002, in connection with this offer, we determined to
on January 28, 2002 grant options under our 2000 Plan to our directors, most of
our officers and other selected senior personnel who will not be eligible to
participate in this offer. The options are apart from date of grant, identical
to the options to be granted hereunder to eligible employees.

            These options represent the right to purchase an aggregate of
2,603,000 of our common shares at an exercise price per share equal to the
market price of our common shares, determined by reference to their closing
sale price on The Toronto Stock Exchange (for persons resident in Canada) and
on the NASDAQ National Market (for persons resident outside of Canada) on
January 25, 2002.

            The following table sets forth the number of options that will be
granted to certain of our directors and executive officers:

ADDITIONAL OPTION GRANTS

            We have employees who generally perform services for us in countries
where our staff count is small or in which the legal, regulatory or tax
requirements may render it difficult for us to enable these individuals to
participate in the offer. However, we believe that it is important for us to
motivate these employees to a similar extent as all of our other employees.
Accordingly, on or about

                                      36

<PAGE>

the date that the new options to be issued to eligible
employees under this offer are granted, which we estimate will occur in August
2002, we plan to issue additional options under our 2000 Plan to these
employees, subject to favorable local tax and regulatory laws. For each option
held by these individuals that has an exercise price of more than U.S.$3.00, or
more than Cdn.$4.75 (if denominated in Canadian dollars), we would grant to each
such individual an option to purchase a common share, with an exercise price
equal to the exercise price otherwise granted to eligible employees who are
issued new options pursuant to this offer. This exercise price is expected to be
the market price of our common shares, determined by reference to their closing
sale price on The Toronto Stock Exchange (for employees resident in Canada) and
on the NASDAQ National Market (for employees resident outside of Canada) on the
last trading day immediately preceding the grant date. These employees would not
be required to surrender or cancel any of their existing options.

            These options will be identical to those being offered herein to
eligible employees. We estimate that we would issue options to purchase an
aggregate of 538,000 common shares to these individuals, including to the
following executive officer:

11. STATUS OF ELIGIBLE OPTIONS ACQUIRED BY US IN THE OFFER; ACCOUNTING
CONSEQUENCES OF THE OFFER.

            Many of our eligible employees hold options with exercise prices
significantly higher than the current market price of our common shares. We
believe that it is in our best interests to offer these eligible employees an
opportunity to more effectively participate in the potential growth of stock
price. We could accomplish this goal by repricing existing options, which would
enable eligible employees to immediately receive new options with an exercise
price equal to our current market price, determined under the terms of the
option plans. However, if we repriced existing options, we could be required
under the financial accounting rules applicable to us to recognize significant
charges in our financial statements relating to the repriced options which would
reduce our reported earnings for each fiscal quarter that the repriced options
remained outstanding. This could have a negative impact on our stock price
performance.

            We believe that we can accomplish our goals of providing eligible
employees the benefit of choosing whether they want to receive options that over
time may have a greater potential to increase in value, without the accounting
consequence described above because:

          we do not expect to grant any new options to eligible employees who
               tender their eligible options in the offer until a day that is
               more than six months and one day from the date we cancel eligible
               options tendered for exchange;

          other than the options described in Section 10, no further
               grants were made to eligible employees (other than new hires) in
               the past six months. Therefore, negative accounting consequences
               are avoided by making an all or nothing offer with respect to
               eligible options;

          the exercise price of all new options will equal the market price of
               our common shares on the future date we grant the new options (as
               determined under the terms of the 2000

                                      37

<PAGE>

               Plan), or 110% of the fair market value of the common shares
               (as determined in accordance with the 2000 Plan) in the event
               that incentive stock options are granted to certain
               substantial shareholders of our company; and

          we do not expect to grant any other options to an eligible employee
               who tenders eligible options in the offer that are cancelled in
               the exchange until after the date on which we grant the new
               options.

            Tendered eligible options that we accept for exchange and acquire in
this offer will be cancelled and will be available for future option grants
(including pursuant to the offer) under the 2000 Plan, except for eligible
options granted under the 1997 Plan. Options available for future grants under
the 2000 Plan will be available for grants to eligible plan participants without
further shareholder action, except as may be required by applicable law or the
rules of any other stock exchange on which our common shares are then quoted or
listed.

            As a result of this offer to exchange, we will be required to
expense up to approximately U.S.$2 million of the related unamortized portion of
the deferred stock based compensation as a one time non-cash stock compensation
expense. We expect to record this expense during the three months ending March
31, 2002.

12.  LEGAL MATTERS; REGULATORY APPROVALS.

            We are not aware of any license or regulatory permit that appears to
be material to our business that might be adversely affected by our exchange of
eligible options and issuance of new options to eligible employees as
contemplated by this offer, or of any approval or other action by any government
or governmental, administrative or regulatory authority or agency, in the United
States, Canada or any other jurisdiction, that would be required for the
acquisition or ownership of our options as contemplated herein, other than such
other approvals as have been obtained by us. We are unable to predict whether we
may determine that we are required to delay the acceptance of eligible options
for exchange pending the outcome of any such matter. We cannot assure you that
any such approval or other action, if needed, would be obtained or would be
obtained without substantial conditions or that the failure to obtain any such
approval or other action might not result in adverse consequences to our
business. Our obligation under the offer to accept any tendered eligible options
for exchange is subject to conditions, including the conditions described in
Section 6.

13.  EXTENSION OF OFFER; TERMINATION; AMENDMENT.

            We may, from time to time, extend the period of time during which
this offer is open and delay accepting any eligible options tendered to us by
announcing the extension and giving oral or written notice of the extension to
eligible employees and making an announcement thereof. If the offer is extended,
then the grant date of the new options will also be extended if necessary to
ensure that the new options are granted more than six months and one day
following the date tendered eligible options are cancelled. We also reserve the
right to grant new options earlier than the day that is six months and one day
after the date of cancellation, if we determine that it is in the best interests
of 724 Solutions and our shareholders to do so. In such event, we will notify
eligible employees, which may be by press release, of the earlier new option
grant date.

            We also expressly reserve the right, in our reasonable judgment,
prior to the expiration date, to terminate or amend the offer and to postpone
our acceptance and cancellation of any eligible options tendered for exchange
upon the occurrence of any of the conditions specified in Section 6, by

                                      38

<PAGE>

giving oral or written notice of such termination or postponement to eligible
employees and making an announcement thereof. Our reservation of the right to
delay our acceptance and cancellation of eligible options tendered for
exchange is limited by Rule 13e-4(f)(5) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act, which requires that we must pay the consideration offered or
return the eligible options tendered promptly after termination or withdrawal
of a tender offer.

            Subject to compliance with applicable law, we further reserve the
right, in our discretion, and regardless of whether any event set forth in
Section 6 has occurred or is deemed by us to have occurred, to amend this offer
in any respect, including, without limitation, by decreasing or increasing the
consideration offered in this offer to eligible employees or by decreasing or
increasing the number of options being sought in the offer.

            Amendments to the offer may be made at any time and from time to
time by an announcement of the amendment. In the case of an extension, the
amendment must be issued no later than 9:00 a.m., eastern standard time, on the
next business day after the last previously scheduled or announced expiration
date. Any announcement made pursuant to the offer will be disseminated promptly
to eligible employees in a manner reasonably designated to inform eligible
employees of such change. Without limiting the manner in which we may choose to
make an announcement, except as required by applicable law, we have no
obligation to publish, advertise or otherwise communicate any such announcement
other than by issuing a press release through our normal channels.

            If we materially change the terms of the offer or the information
concerning the offer, or if we waive a material condition of the offer, we will
extend the offer to the extent required by Rules 13e-4(d)(2) and 13e-4(e)(3)
under the Securities Exchange Act. These rules require that the minimum period
during which an offer must remain open following material changes in the terms
of the offer or information concerning the offer, other than a change in price
or a change in percentage of securities sought, will depend on the facts and
circumstances, including the relative materiality of such terms or information.

14.  FEES AND EXPENSES.

            We will not pay any fees or commissions to any broker, dealer or
other person for soliciting tenders of eligible options pursuant to this offer

16.  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.

            This offer to exchange includes forward-looking statements. When
used in this offer to exchange, the words "could", "may", "anticipate",
"believe", "estimate", "expect", "intend", "plan" and similar expressions as
they relate to 724 Solutions or our management are intended to identify these
forward-looking statements. These statements include our statements regarding
our plans to complete the offer, including the times at which we will accept
eligible options for cancellation and issue new options, the anticipated effect
of this offer to exchange on our future financial statements, and our
compensation plans concerning our officers and employees.

            These forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks
and uncertainties, including the possibility that the financial accounting rules
applicable to us may change, causing us to recognize significant charges in our
financial statements which could reduce our reported results in future periods;
changes in the trading price and the trading volume of our common shares during
the program and in the period between the cancellation of the old options and
the issuance of new options; corporate developments affecting 724 Solutions

            Our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
referred to herein discuss some of the important risk factors that may affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

            These risks are also described in our filings with the Canadian
Securities Administrators, including our prospectuses, material change reports,
Annual Information Form and Management Information Circular.

            The safe harbour for forward-looking statements contained in the
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 protects companies from liability for
their forward-looking statements if they comply with the requirements of the
Act. However, the Act does not provide this protection for transactions that
constitute a tender offer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and will
not be available for our forward-looking statements contained in this offer if
this offer is deemed to constitute a tender offer.

discretion, take any actions necessary for us to make this offer to employees in
any such jurisdiction.

            Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer
to Exchange dated January 24, 2002 (the "Offer to Exchange"), my receipt of
which I hereby acknowledge, and in this Acceptance Letter (this "Letter" which,
together with the Offer to Exchange, as they may be amended from time to time,
constitutes the "Offer"), I, the undersigned, hereby tender to 724 Solutions
Inc., a Canadian corporation (the "Company"), all of my options to purchase
common shares of 724 Solutions Inc. (the "Common Shares"), having an exercise
price of more than U.S.$3.00 if the exercise price is denominated in United
States currency or more than Cdn.$4.75 if denominated in Canadian currency,
granted under the 724 Solutions Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended and
restated (the "1997 Plan"), granted after January 15, 2001 under the Tantau
Software Inc. 1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended, assumed by 724 Solutions (the
"Tantau Plan"), and granted under the 724 Solutions Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan,
as amended and restated (such stock option plan, the "2000 Plan"; all of such
plans collectively, the "Option Plans"; and such options, the "Tendered
Options") that are outstanding on the expiration date of the Offer. I
acknowledge that, subject to the conditions set out herein, I will be granted
new options to purchase Common Shares under the 2000 Plan ("New Options"). The
number of Common Shares subject to the New Options to be granted will be equal
to the number of Common Shares subject to the Tendered Options that are


                                      43

<PAGE>

accepted for exchange and cancelled, subject to adjustments for any future
stock splits, certain stock dividends and similar events, in accordance with
the terms of the 2000 Plan. New Options will be subject to the terms of the
2000 Plan and the related stock option agreement between the Company and the
undersigned.

            Subject to, and effective upon, the Company's acceptance for
exchange of the Tendered Options in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer (including, if the Offer is extended or amended, the
terms and conditions of any such extension or amendment), I hereby sell, assign
and transfer to, or upon the order of, the Company all right, title and interest
in and to the Tendered Options.

            I hereby represent and warrant that I have full power and authority
to tender the Tendered Options and that, when and to the extent that the
Tendered Options are accepted for exchange by the Company, the Tendered Options
will be free and clear of all security interests, liens, restrictions, charges,
encumbrances, conditional sales agreements or other obligations relating to the
sale or transfer thereof (other than pursuant to the applicable stock option
agreement) and the Tendered Options will not be subject to any adverse claims.
Upon request, I will execute and deliver any additional documents deemed by the
Company to be necessary or desirable to complete the exchange of the Tendered
Options pursuant to the Offer.

            I understand and acknowledge that:

          (1)  I may tender all of my eligible options to purchase Common Shares
               granted under the Option Plans and that I am not required to
               tender any of such options in the Offer. However, if I wish to
               tender any options I must tender all of my eligible options
               granted under the Option Plans (no partial tender of options is
               permitted).

          (2)  All Tendered Options properly tendered prior to 11:59 p.m.,
               eastern standard time, on February 21, 2002, unless the Company
               has extended the period of time the Offer will remain open (the
               "Expiration Date"), and not properly withdrawn that are cancelled
               in the Offer will be exchanged for New Options, upon the terms
               and subject to the conditions of the Offer, including my
               continued employment and the other conditions described in the
               Offer to Exchange.

          (3)  Upon the Company's acceptance of the Tendered Options, I
               understand that the instrument or instruments of grant to which
               the Tendered Options are subject will terminate automatically and
               the Company will terminate and cancel all then outstanding
               options thereunder. All New Options will be subject to the terms
               and conditions of the 2000 Plan, including the amendments thereto
               made on January 23, 2002 regarding acceleration of vesting upon a
               change of control (as described in Section 8 of the Offer to
               Exchange), and the terms of a new stock option agreement to be
               issued by the Company, a copy of which I will receive when the
               New Options are granted.

          (4)  The New Options are expected to be granted by August 29, 2002 to
               eligible employees who are actively employed on that grant date.
               If the offer is extended, then the grant date of the New Options
               will also be extended if necessary to ensure that the new option
               grant date is at least six months and one day after the date the
               Tendered Options are cancelled. However, the Company reserves the
               right to grant New

                                      44
<PAGE>

               Options earlier than the day that is six months and one day after
               the date of cancellation, if the Company determines that it is
               in the best interests of 724 Solutions and its shareholders to
               do so.

          (5)  Subject to Section 5 and 6 of the Offer to Exchange, the New
               Options will have (a) an exercise price equal to 100% of the
               market price of the Common Shares on the grant date of the New
               Options, determined by reference to the closing sale price on the
               last trading day immediately preceding the New Option grant date
               of the Common Shares on The Toronto Stock Exchange (for employees
               resident in Canada) and on the NASDAQ National Market (for
               employees resident outside of Canada), (b) a term of ten years
               from the date of grant of the New Options, subject to earlier
               expiration upon termination of employment, death or retirement,
               and (c) a vesting schedule whereby New Options in respect of 25%
               of the Common Shares that may be purchased under the new grant
               will vest at the time of the new grant, with an additional 25%
               vesting on each anniversary date of the grant of New Options,
               until all such New Options become exercisable, subject to earlier
               expiration upon termination of employment, death or retirement.

          (6)  If I am a United States citizen whose Tendered Options are
               incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
               Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (an "incentive stock option"), and
               if I will hold more than 10% of the voting power of all classes
               of shares of 724 Solutions, or any Parent or Subsidiary, as
               defined in the 2000 Plan, at the time New Options are granted to
               me, then (a) the exercise price of my New Options will be equal
               to 110% of the fair market value of the Common Shares on the date
               of grant of the New Options in accordance with the 2000 Plan; and
               (b) my New Options will have a term of five years from the date
               of grant of the New Options, subject to earlier expiration upon
               my termination of employment, death or retirement. Furthermore,
               if the aggregate exercise price of my New Options (taking into
               consideration any outstanding incentive stock options that are
               not tendered and will vest in the same year as my New Options)
               exceeds $100,000, then any New Options in excess of $100,000
               shall not be treated as incentive stock options.

          (7)  To be entitled to the New Options after my Tendered Options have
               been cancelled in the Offer, I must meet all of the following
               conditions:

               (i)  I must have been continuously employed by 724 Solutions or
                    one of its subsidiaries from the date I tendered Tendered
                    Options for exchange to and on the date of grant of the New
                    Options, and I must be principally resident on the date of
                    grant of the New Options in Canada (not including the
                    province of Quebec), the United States, the United Kingdom
                    (other than Scotland), or Germany; and

               (ii) Prior to the New Option grant date, I must not have:

                    -    received a notice of involuntary termination
                         (including, without limitation, redundancy) from 724
                         Solutions or one of its subsidiaries;

                    -    resigned or given notice of resignation from such
                         employment;

                    -    retired or elected to retire from such employment;

                         its subsidiaries with respect to my resignation or

                    -    ceased to be employed with 724 Solutions or one of its
                         subsidiaries as a direct result of a business
                         transaction (either through a sale, corporate spin-off,
                         joint venture or similar business transaction) or the
                         outsourcing of my position; or

                    -    otherwise ceased to be an "eligible individual" for
                         purposes of the 2000 Plan,

                    unless on the New Option grant date I am an employee of 724
                    Solutions or one of its subsidiaries, in respect of which
                    none of the foregoing events has occurred.

               If for any reason I do not meet all of the foregoing conditions,
               I will not receive any New Options or any other consideration or
               payment for the Tendered Options. In addition, my estate will not
               receive any New Options if I die after the cancellation of my
               Tendered Options and before the New Option grant date.

          (8)  By tendering the Tendered Options pursuant to the procedure
               described in Section 3 of the Offer to Exchange and in the
               instructions to this Letter, I accept the terms and conditions of
               the Offer. The Company's acceptance for exchange of the Tendered
               Options will constitute a binding agreement between the Company
               and me upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer.

          (9)  Under certain circumstances set forth in the Offer to Exchange,
               the Company may terminate or amend the Offer, or postpone its
               acceptance and cancellation of any Tendered Options.

          (10) If I choose not to tender all of my options that are eligible for
               tender under the Offer or my Tendered Options are not accepted
               for exchange, all such options shall remain outstanding and
               retain their current exercise price and vesting schedule.

          (11) The Company has advised me to consult with my own advisors
               (including my own tax advisors) as to the consequences of
               participating or not participating in the Offer.

          (12) Subject to the limitations of applicable securities laws, I
               authorize the Company to transmit any further communications to
               me relating to the Offer by way of e-mail, including the
               Company's internal e-mail.

          (13) The Company is reserving the right, in the event of a merger,
               sale, takeover, change of control transaction or similar
               transaction, to take any actions that it deems necessary or
               appropriate to complete a transaction that the Company's board of
               directors believes is in the best interests of the Company and
               its shareholders. This could include terminating my right to
               receive New Options under this offer to exchange. If the Company
               were to terminate my right to receive New Options under the Offer
               in connection with such a transaction, and I had tendered
               Tendered Options


                                      46
<PAGE>

               for cancellation in this offer, I will not receive New Options
               under this offer, options to purchase securities of an acquiror
               or any other consideration for my Tendered Options.

          (14) The Company is also reserving the right, if after the
               cancellation of tendered Tendered Options there is a change,
               development, clarification or position taken in generally
               accepted accounting principles which could or would require the
               Company for financial reporting purposes to record compensation
               expense against its earnings in connection with the offer or the
               grant of the New Options, to not grant me New Options under this
               offer or give me any other consideration for my Tendered Options.

            All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall not
be affected by, and shall survive, my death or incapacity, and all of my
obligations hereunder shall be binding upon my heirs, personal representatives,
successors and assigns. Except as stated in the Offer, this tender is
irrevocable.

            The Offer is not being made to (nor will tenders of options be
accepted from or on behalf of) eligible employees in any jurisdiction in which
the making or acceptance of the Offer would not be in compliance with the laws
of such jurisdiction, as determined by 724 Solutions.

                                  INSTRUCTIONS

              FORMING PART OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

1.   Delivery of Acceptance Letter. A properly completed and signed original of
     the signature page of this Letter (or a facsimile thereof) must be received
     by the Company at its address or facsimile number set forth on the front
     cover of this Letter on or before the Expiration Date. Only the signature
     page of this Letter is required to be delivered to the Company; you are not
     required to deliver the instruments of grant for Tendered Options or any of
     the other pages of the Letter.

     The only acceptable methods of delivery of the signed signature page are
     facsimile, inter-office mail, courier or regular external mail, as
     indicated above. The method by which you deliver the signed signature page
     is at your option and risk, and the delivery will be deemed made only when
     actually received by the Company. If you elect to deliver your signed
     signature page by external mail, the Company recommends that you use
     registered mail with return receipt requested. Delivery by e-mail will not
     be accepted. In all cases, you should allow sufficient time to ensure
     timely delivery.

2.   Withdrawal. Tenders of eligible options made pursuant to the Offer may be
     withdrawn at any time prior to 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time, on
     February 21, 2002. You must withdraw all Tendered Options; you may not
     withdraw only a portion of Tendered Options. If the Offer is extended by
     the Company beyond that time, you may withdraw your Tendered Options at any
     time until the extended expiration of the Offer. In addition, unless the
     Company accepts your Tendered Options before 11:59 p.m., eastern standard
     time, on March 21, 2002, you may withdraw your Tendered Options at any time
     after March 21, 2002. To withdraw Tendered Options we must receive the
     withdrawal letter in the form attached to the end of the Offer document, or
     a facsimile thereof, signed by you while you still have the right to
     withdraw the Tendered Options. Withdrawals may not be rescinded and any
     Tendered Options withdrawn will thereafter be deemed not properly tendered
     for purposes of the Offer unless such withdrawn options are properly
     re-tendered prior to the Expiration Date by following the procedures
     described above.

3.   Tenders. If you intend to tender eligible options pursuant to the Offer,
     you must tender all of your eligible options that are outstanding on the
     Expiration Date.

     The Company will not accept any alternative, conditional or contingent
     tenders. All tendering Eligible Employees, by signing this Letter (or a
     facsimile of it), waive any right to receive any notice of the acceptance
     of their tender, except the notice provided for in the Offer to Exchange.

4.   Signatures on This Acceptance Letter. If this Letter is signed by the
     Eligible Employee who is the holder of the Tendered Options, the signature
     must be by such employee. If this Letter is signed by a trustee, executor,
     administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation or
     other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such person
     should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory to the
     Company of the authority of such person so to act must be submitted with
     this Letter.


                                      48

5.   Requests for Assistance or Additional Copies. Any questions or requests for
     assistance, as well as requests for additional copies of the Offer to
     Exchange or this Letter may be directed to Calvin Barrett, at the address
     and telephone number given on the front cover of this Letter. Copies will
     be furnished at the Company's expense.

6.   Irregularities. All questions as to the number of eligible options to be
     accepted for exchange, and the validity, form, eligibility (including time
     of receipt) and acceptance for exchange of any tender of eligible options
     will be determined by the Company in its discretion, which determinations
     shall be final and binding on all parties. The Company reserves the right
     to reject any or all tenders of eligible options the Company determines not
     to be in proper form or the acceptance of which may, in the opinion of the
     Company's counsel, be unlawful. The Company also reserves the right to
     waive any of the conditions of the Offer and any defect or irregularity in
     the tender of any particular eligible options, and the Company's
     interpretation of the terms of the Offer (including these instructions)
     will be final and binding on all parties. No tender of eligible options
     will be deemed to be properly made until all defects and irregularities
     have been cured or waived. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in
     connection with tenders must be cured within such time as the Company shall
     determine. Neither the Company nor any other person is or will be obligated
     to give notice of any defects or irregularities in tenders, and no person
     will incur any liability for failure to give any such notice.

7.   Important Tax Information. You should refer to the tax information provided
     to you with the Offer to Exchange. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT
     WITH YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THIS OFFER
     UNDER THE LAWS OF THE COUNTRY AND LOCALITY THAT APPLY TO YOU.

            Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer
to Exchange dated January 24, 2002 (the "Offer to Exchange") and my Acceptance
Letter, dated __________________________ (the "Acceptance Letter" which,
together with the Offer to Exchange, as they may be amended from time to time,
constitutes the "Offer"), I tendered to 724 Solutions Inc., a Canadian
corporation (the "Company"), all of my options to purchase common shares of 724
Solutions Inc. (the "Common Shares"), having an exercise price of more than
U.S.$3.00 if the exercise price is denominated in United States currency and
Cdn.$4.75 if denominated in Canadian currency, granted under the 724 Solutions
Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated (the "1997 Plan"), or
granted after January 15, 2001 under the Tantau Software Inc. 1999 Stock Option
Plan, as amended, assumed by 724 Solutions (the "Tantau Plan"), and granted
under the 724 Solutions Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated
(such stock option plan, the "2000 Plan"; all of such plans collectively, the
"Option Plans") that were outstanding on the Expiration Date (as defined below)
(my "Tendered Options"), in exchange for "New Options" to be granted under the
terms of the Offer. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer, I understand that I can withdraw the tender of my Tendered Options prior
to 11:59 p.m., eastern standard time, on February 21, 2002, unless the Company
has extended the period of time the Offer will remain open (the "Expiration
Date"). In addition, unless the Company accepts my Tendered Options before 11:59
p.m., eastern standard time, March 21, 2002, I understand that I may


                                      51

<PAGE>

withdraw my Tendered Options at any time after March 21, 2002. Accordingly,
under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer and this
Withdrawal Letter (this "Withdrawal Letter"), I, the undersigned, hereby
withdraw the tender of all my Tendered Options.

            I understand and acknowledge that:

          (1)  I may not rescind my withdrawal and the Tendered Options that I
               hereby withdraw will be deemed not properly tendered for purposes
               of the Offer unless I re-tender those options prior to the
               Expiration Date by following the procedures described in Section
               3 of the Offer to Exchange.

          (2)  I must withdraw all of my Tendered Options; I may not withdraw
               only a portion of my Tendered Options. If I attempt to withdraw
               only a portion of my Tendered Options, this withdrawal will not
               be effective, and no Tendered Options will be withdrawn. Upon
               withdrawal of my Tendered Options, I understand that all such
               options shall remain outstanding pursuant to their original terms
               and conditions, including their exercise prices and vesting
               schedule.

          (3)  Neither the Company nor any other person is obligated to give
               notice of any defects or irregularities in any withdrawal letter,
               nor will anyone incur any liability for failure to give any such
               notice. The Company will determine, in its discretion, all
               questions as to the form and validity, including time of receipt,
               of withdrawal letters. Our determination of these matters will be
               final and binding.

          (4)  All authority herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall
               not be affected by, and shall survive, my death or incapacity,
               and all of my obligations hereunder shall be binding upon my
               heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. As
               stated above, this withdrawal may not be rescinded.

          (5)  I agree to all of the terms and conditions of the Offer and this
               withdrawal letter.

          (6)  This letter must be completed and signed in the same name that
               appears on the Acceptance Letter previously submitted by the
               eligible employee who tendered the Tendered Options. If the
               signature is by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian,
               attorney-in-fact, officer of a corporation or another person
               acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, the signer's
               full title must be specified and proper evidence of the authority
               of such person to act in such capacity must be submitted with
               this letter.

IMPORTANT: To withdraw the tender of Tendered Options, the signed withdrawal
letter (or a facsimile copy thereof) must be received by the Company on or prior
to the Expiration Date. A properly signed paper copy of this letter must be
delivered by facsimile, inter-office mail, courier or regular external mail.
Delivery by e-mail will not be accepted. The method by which the letter is
delivered is at the employee's option and risk, and the delivery will be deemed
made only when actually received by the Company. If the signed letter is
delivered by regular external mail, the Company recommends that registered mail
with return receipt requested be used. In all cases, sufficient time should be
allowed to ensure timely delivery.

LETTER AND E-MAIL MESSAGES TO DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF 724
SOLUTIONS

E-MAIL TO 724 SOLUTIONS EMPLOYEES ACCOMPANYING OFFER, DATED JANUARY 24, 2002

January 24, 2002

All,

We have been considering ways of effectively reducing the exercise price of
your "underwater" stock options. By doing so, we hope to give you an
opportunity to share in the rebuilding of 724 Solutions, allowing you to
realize value from these "underwater" options.

YOU ARE AN "ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE" AND WE ARE OFFERING TO REPLACE YOUR
"UNDERWATER" ELIGIBLE OPTIONS (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) WITH NEW OPTIONS, ON A
ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO GRANT TO YOU (PROVIDED THAT YOU REMAIN
OUR EMPLOYEE UNTIL THAT TIME) IN AUGUST 2002 AT MARKET PRICES ON THE DATE OF
THE GRANT.

Full details are contained in the Offer to Exchange document (first
attachment below) that we are legally required to prepare and distribute to
you. Employees are urged to thoroughly review the many important details
contained in the attached Offer to Exchange document before making this
important decision.

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE OFFER

          -    The new options will be 25% vested immediately upon grant next
               August (i.e. no initial one year "waiting period") and an
               additional 25% will vest on each anniversary date of the grant
               of the new options. By the third anniversary date of the new
               grant, the new options will be fully vested.

          -    The new options will be issued under our 2000 Stock Option
               Plan, which you should note has recently been amended for
               purposes of future grants to delay full vesting upon a change
               in control for one year subsequent to such an event.

          -    The options that are eligible for exchange are all options
               with a strike price greater than U.S.$3.00 (Cdn.$4.75) granted
               under any of our options plans, except our Ezlogin Plan and
               options granted before January 16, 2001 under our Tantau Plan.

               You will be receiving a personalized listing of your eligible
               options.

              LETTER AND E-MAIL TO CERTAIN 724 SOLUTIONS DIRECTORS,
             OFFICERS AND SENIOR EMPLOYEES, DATED JANUARY 24, 2002

January 24, 2002



CONFIDENTIAL

Dear (personalized),

Earlier today, we provided many employees with a formal offer to replace
their "underwater" stock options (options with a strike price greater that
U.S.$3.00 or Cdn.$4.75) for new options, on a one-for-one basis that we
currently expect to grant at market prices in August 2002. A formal document
describing this offer was filed today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We did this to allow employees to share in the rewards as we
rebuild 724 Solutions, allowing them to realize value from their options.

Instead of participating in the above offer, I am pleased to advise you that
the Board of Directors has agreed to award to you on January 28, 2002, xxxx
additional options with a strike price equal to the closing share price on
January 25, 2002, to acknowledge your valuable contribution and to encourage
you to continue to strive for the success of 724 Solutions.

These options will have a term of 10 years and will be immediately 25% vested
upon grant (i.e., no initial one-year "waiting period") and further vest at
an additional 25% on each anniversary date of the grant, such that they are
fully vested by the 3rd anniversary.

These options are incremental to options you may already have. WE WILL NOT
REQUIRE YOU TO SURRENDER OR CANCEL ANY OF YOUR CURRENT OPTIONS.

You will be provided with the related option agreements shortly.

Because of this special initiative, we have decided to suspend our
traditional semi-annual grants until January 2003.

We thank you for your continued efforts to drive 724 Solutions to success!

Sincerely,

John Sims

Please Note:  A hard copy of this letter has also been sent to you.

E-MAIL TO CERTAIN 724 SOLUTIONS NON-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, DATED JANUARY 24, 2002

January 24, 2002

All,

We have been considering ways of effectively reducing the exercise price of
your "underwater" stock options. By doing so, we hope to give you an
opportunity to share in the rebuilding of 724 Solutions, allowing you to
realize value from these "underwater" options.

Earlier today, we provided many employees with a formal offer to replace
their "underwater" stock options (options with a strike price greater that
U.S.$3.00 or Cdn.$4.75) for new options, on a one-for-one basis, that we
currently expect to grant at market prices in August 2002. A formal document
describing this offer was filed today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

However, for employees like yourself, who generally live and work in small
offices or in countries where legal, tax or regulatory requirements are
restrictive, a different approach is being considered which provides you with
essentially the same benefits.

WE ARE PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT WE ARE PLANNING TO GIVE YOU A SPECIAL
SUPPLEMENTAL OPTION GRANT IN AUGUST 2002 (PROVIDED THAT YOU REMAIN AN
EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY UNTIL THAT TIME).

Provided there are no adverse tax or legal consequences, you will receive one
additional option for each option you currently hold (other than options
granted under the Ezlogin Plan) that has a strike price greater than
U.S.$3.00 or Cdn.$4.75. The new options will have a term of 10 years and will
be 25% vested immediately upon grant in August (i.e. no initial one-year
"waiting period"). An additional 25% will vest on each anniversary date of
grant. You will be provided with the related option agreements in August or
early September. WE WILL NOT REQUIRE YOU TO SURRENDER OR CANCEL ANY OF YOUR
EXISTING OPTIONS.

Because of this special initiative, we have decided to suspend our
traditional semi-annual grants until after the supplemental options are
granted in August 2002. We expect to resume these semi-annual grants in
January 2003.

We believe this initiative acknowledges your valuable contribution and I
encourage you to continue to strive for success at 724 Solutions.

If you have any questions, please contact Calvin Barrett (416-226-2900 Ext.
5149).

                                                                 Exhibit (a) (5)

             MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.

            The following is a general summary of the material United States
Federal income tax consequences of the exchange of eligible options and the
grant of the new options pursuant to this offer applicable to the eligible
United States subsidiaries of 724 Solutions and to those eligible employees who
are United States citizens or residents of the United States. This discussion is
based on the now applicable provisions of the United States Internal Revenue
Code and the regulations thereunder, all of which are subject to change,
possibly on a retroactive basis. This summary does not discuss all of the tax
consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular
circumstances, nor is it intended to be applicable in all respects to all
categories of option holders.

            Eligible employees who are United States citizens or residents of
the United States who exchange eligible options for new options will not be
required to recognize income for United States Federal income tax purposes at
the time of the exchange. We believe that the exchange will be treated as a
non-taxable exchange for United States Federal income tax purposes. At the date
of grant of the new options eligible employees who are United States citizens or
residents of the United States will not be required to recognize income for
United States Federal income tax purposes. The grant of options is not
recognized as taxable income for United States Federal income tax purposes.

            GENERAL FEDERAL TAX TREATMENT OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. Generally,
there are no federal income tax consequences to you or 724 Solutions by reason
of the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option. However, the exercise of
an incentive stock option may increase your alternative minimum tax ("AMT")
liability, if any. (However, the United States Internal Revenue Service recently
issued proposed regulations which would subject you to withholding at the time
you exercise an incentive stock option for Social Security, Medicare and other
payroll taxes (not including income tax) based upon the excess of the stock's
fair market value on the date of exercise over the exercise price. These
proposed regulations, if adopted, would be effective only for the exercise of
incentive stock options on or after January 1, 2003.)

            If you hold stock for more than two years from the date on which the
incentive stock option is granted and more than one year from the date on which
the shares are issued to you upon exercise of the incentive stock option, any
gain or loss on a disposition of such stock will be a long term capital gain or
loss. In this event, 724 Solutions will not be allowed a business expense
deduction with respect to the disposition of shares.

            However, if you dispose of the stock before the expiration of either
of the above-stated holding periods (a "disqualifying disposition"), at the time
of disposition you will realize taxable ordinary income equal to the lesser of
(1) the excess of the fair market value on the date of exercise over the
exercise price, or (2) your actual gain, if any, on the purchase and sale. Your
additional gain or any loss upon the disqualifying disposition will be a capital
gain or loss which will be long-term or short-term depending on how long you
held the stock. To the extent you recognize ordinary income by reason of a
disqualifying disposition, 724 Solutions will be entitled, subject to the
requirement of reasonableness (and perhaps, in the future, the satisfaction of a
withholding obligation), to a corresponding business expense deduction in the
tax year in which the disposition occurs.


                                      58
<PAGE>

            As mentioned above, the EXERCISE of an incentive stock option may
increase your AMT liability. This is because the difference between the exercise
price of an incentive stock option and the fair market value of the shares on
the date of exercise must be claimed as an item of adjustment for AMT purposes.
If your AMT liability exceeds your regular income tax liability, you will owe
the larger amount of taxes. In order to avoid the application of AMT with
respect to incentive stock options, you must sell the shares within the same
calendar year in which the incentive stock options are exercised. However, such
a sale of shares within the same year of exercise will constitute a
disqualifying disposition, as described above.

            TAX IMPACT OF THE EXCHANGE ON INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. If your
current options are incentive stock options, your new options will be granted as
incentive stock options to the extent they qualify. Generally, for options to
qualify as incentive stock options for United States tax purposes, the value of
shares subject to options that first become exercisable in any one calendar year
cannot exceed $100,000, as determined based upon the exercise price of the
options. Any excess value must be allocated as non-qualified stock options.
Therefore, your new options will qualify as incentive stock options if the total
exercise price of your new options that vest in a calendar year is less than
$100,000, taking into consideration any outstanding incentive stock options that
are not tendered in the exchange and will vest in the year you receive your new
options. However, if the total exercise price of your new options that are
incentive stock options in the aggregate with any other incentive stock options
that vest in this calendar year exceeds $100,000, the excess amount will be
treated as non-qualified stock options.

            TAX IMPACT OF NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE EXCHANGE ON INCENTIVE STOCK
OPTIONS. If you choose not to tender all your eligible options for exchange (or
if we do not accept tendered options for exchange, or you withdraw your tender
of options prior to the expiration date of the offer), your eligible options
will remain outstanding and retain their current exercise prices. However, if
the options which you do not tender are vested incentive stock options, a
portion of your options may cease to qualify as incentive stock options. This is
because all your vested options will be treated as becoming newly granted and
exercisable as of the date of the offer (even if your incentive stock options
became exercisable in prior years). To the extent that the fair market value of
the stock underlying your vested incentive stock options exceeds $100,000 (such
amount reduced by the value of any other incentive stock options that become
exercisable this year prior to the date of this offer), the excess value will
have to be treated as non-qualified stock options. Thus, if you currently have
vested incentive stock options and you choose not to participate in this
exchange offer, some of your incentive stock options could automatically be
converted to non-qualified options.

            Because incentive stock options that are not tendered are treated as
becoming newly granted as of the date of the offer, your incentive stock options
will be subject to new holding periods in order to attain long-term capital gain
or loss treatment Thus, you will have to hold stock for more than two years from
the date of the offer and more than one year from the date on which the shares
are issued to you upon exercise of the incentive stock option in order for any
gain or loss on a disposition of such stock to be deemed long term capital gain
or loss. If you dispose of the stock before the expiration of either of the
above-stated holding periods, you will be treated as having made a disqualifying
disposition, as described above.

            GENERAL FEDERAL TAX TREATMENT OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. There
generally are no tax consequences to you or 724 Solutions by reason of the grant
of a non-qualified stock option. Upon exercise of a non-qualified stock option,
you will recognize taxable ordinary income equal to the


                                      59
<PAGE>

excess of the stock's fair market value on the date of exercise over the
exercise price. Generally, with respect to employees, 724 Solutions is
required to withhold from regular wages or supplemental wage payments an
amount based on the ordinary income recognized. Subject to the requirement of
reasonableness, the satisfaction of any withholding obligation and the
limitations under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, 724 Solutions
will be entitled to a business expense deduction equal to the taxable
ordinary income realized by you. Upon disposition of the stock, you will
recognize a capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the selling
price and the sum of the amount paid for such stock plus any amount
recognized as ordinary income upon exercise of the option. Such gain or loss
will be long or short term depending on how long you have held the stock.

            TAX IMPACT OF THE EXCHANGE ON NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS. If you
tender options that are non-qualified stock options and those options are
accepted for exchange, your new options will be granted as non-qualified
options.

            TAX IMPACT OF NOT PARTICIPATING IN EXCHANGE ON NON-QUALIFIED STOCK
OPTIONS. If you choose not to tender all your eligible non-qualified stock
options for exchange (or if we do not accept tendered options for exchange, or
you withdraw your tender of options prior to the expiration date of the offer),
your non-qualified stock options will remain outstanding and retain their
current exercise prices and other current terms.

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.

                   MATERIAL CANADIAN INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.

            The following is a general summary of the material Canadian federal
income tax considerations relevant to the transactions contemplated in this
offer applicable to eligible employees who are residents of Canada for purposes
of the INCOME TAX ACT (Canada) (the "Canadian Act") ("Eligible Canadian
Employees").

            This summary is based upon the current provisions of the Canadian
Act, the related Income Tax Regulations, all specific proposals to amend the
Canadian Act and related regulations publicly announced by or on behalf of the
Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof and the current
administrative practices of, as published in writing by, the Canada Customs and
Revenue Agency ("CCRA"). This summary does not take into account or anticipate
any other changes in law and does not take into account provincial or
territorial tax consequences (except where specific reference is made) or the
tax laws of a country other than Canada. This summary is based on the assumption
that the shares will be listed on a prescribed stock exchange within the meaning
of the Canadian Act at all relevant times.

            The exchange of eligible options for new options may be governed by
certain rules in the Canadian Act which provide for a non-taxable exchange of
options. In the event that these rules do not apply, Eligible Canadian Employees
will be considered to have disposed of the eligible options for Canadian tax
purposes. In such case, Eligible Canadian Employees will be required to include
in computing income from employment the value of the consideration for the
disposition of the eligible options cancelled. In our view, the value of the
consideration for the disposition of the eligible options will be nil. Eligible
Canadian Employees are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to whether the
non-taxable exchange provisions of the Canadian Act will apply.

            Eligible Canadian Employees will not be required to include an
amount in income in respect of the grant of the new options.

            Subject to the discussion below regarding CCPC Options, where in a
taxation year an Eligible Canadian Employee acquires shares on the exercise of a
new option, the amount, if any, by which the value at that time of the shares so
acquired exceeds the amount paid by the Eligible Canadian Employee to acquire
the shares (the "Stock Option Benefit") will be deemed to be a benefit received
by the Eligible Canadian Employee and included in computing the Eligible
Canadian Employee's income. The Eligible Canadian Employee will be entitled to
deduct one half of the Stock Option Benefit in computing the Eligible Canadian
Employee's taxable income provided the shares qualify as "prescribed shares" for
purposes of the Canadian Act at the time of their issue. In general terms, a
prescribed share is an ordinary common share where neither the Company nor
certain persons in relation to the Company has a right or obligation to redeem,
acquire or cancel the share and there is no reasonable expectation that the
Company will redeem or acquire the share within two years of its issue. Subject
to certain conditions and limits, an Eligible Canadian Employee may be permitted
to defer the income inclusion from the exercise of stock options until the
disposition of the shares on up to $100,000 of options vesting in a year.


                                      61

<PAGE>

            Note that certain eligible options tendered pursuant to this offer
may have been issued by the Company when it was a Canadian-controlled private
corporation ("CCPC") for purposes of the Canadian Act ("CCPC Options"). If, as
discussed above, the cancellation of the eligible options and grant of new
options is treated as a non-taxable exchange of options, where the eligible
options were CCPC Options, the new options will generally be treated as CCPC
Options. However, where the non-taxable exchange rules do not apply, the new
options granted to Eligible Canadian Employees will not be CCPC Options, and
will not be eligible for the special treatment afforded to CCPC Options under
the Canadian Act. In general, an Eligible Canadian Employee who exercises CCPC
Options is not required to include the Stock Option Benefit in income in the
year options are exercised. Instead, the Stock Option Benefit is included in
income in the year the shares acquired on the exercise of the option are
disposed of.

            The amount of the Stock Option Benefit will be included in computing
the adjusted cost base to the Eligible Canadian Employee of the shares acquired
on the exercise of the option and, generally, averaged with the adjusted cost
base to the Eligible Canadian Employee of other common shares of 724 Solutions
held as capital property. However, subject to certain conditions and the
detailed requirements of the Tax Act, the adjusted cost base of shares acquired
on the exercise of options will not be averaged with the adjusted cost base of
other common shares of 724 Solutions where (i) the shares so acquired are sold
within 30 days of acquisition or (ii) the inclusion of the Stock Option Benefit
is deferred until the year of disposition of the shares.

            In general, a disposition, or a deemed disposition, of shares by an
Eligible Canadian Employee who holds such shares as capital property will give
rise to a capital gain (or capital loss) to the extent that the proceeds of
disposition net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are exceeded
by) the adjusted cost base of such shares to the Eligible Canadian Employee.
Generally, one half of any such gain (the "taxable capital gain") will be
included in computing the Eligible Canadian Employee's income for the year of
disposition, and the Eligible Canadian Employee may normally deduct one half of
any such loss for the year of disposition or preceding or future years (subject
to limitations and adjustments contained in the Canadian Act) to the extent of
taxable capital gains.

            To the extent Eligible Canadian Employees are subject to tax in the
Province of Ontario, the provincial income tax considerations are substantially
the same as those described above.

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.

Description of Tax Consequences to Employees in Germany

        DESCRIPTION OF TAX CONSEQUENCES TO EMPLOYEES RESIDENT IN GERMANY

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.

The following is a general summary of the material German income tax
consequences of the exchange of eligible options and the grant of the new
options, pursuant to this offer applicable to German subsidiaries or German
branches of subsidiaries of 724 Solutions and to those eligible employees who
are residents of Germany (excluding expatriates). This discussion is based on
the applicable provisions of the German tax legislation in force on January 24,
2002, which are subject to change.

            Eligible employees who are German residents who exchange eligible
options for new options will not be required to recognize income for German
income tax purposes at the time of the exchange. We believe that the exchange
will be treated as a non-taxable exchange for German income tax purposes. At the
date of grant of the new options, eligible employees who are German residents
will not be required to recognize income for German income tax purposes.
The grant of options is not recognized as taxable income for German income tax
purposes.

            Upon the exercise of a new option the optionee will recognize income
from employment, taxable as ordinary income, in an amount equal to the
excess of:

          (a)  the fair market value of the purchased shares on the date such
               option is exercised, over

          (b)  the exercise price of the shares purchased upon such exercise.

            The income will be subject to regular rates of income tax. However,
from January 1, 2002 on there will be a limited tax exemption for shares granted
to employees, if the contribution of the employer does not exceed Euro 154, --
in a calendar year and half of the market value of the shares granted.

            Upon any subsequent sale of such shares, the optionee will recognize
a capital gain (or loss) in an amount equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale of the shares and the acquisition costs of such shares
(including all other income from speculative gains). Depending on the optionee's
situation, taxes may or may not be payable on any capital gain:

          (a)  If the optionee sells the shares more than 1 year after
               exercising the options, the capital gain will not be taxable.

          (b)  If the optionee sells the shares within 1 year after exercising
               the options, and the taxable amount (including all other income
               from speculative gains) is less than Euro 512, -- that capital
               gain will not be taxable.


                                      63

<PAGE>

          (c)  If the optionee sells the shares within 1 year after exercising
               the options and the taxable amount (including all other income
               from speculative gains) is Euro 512, -- or more the capital gain
               (from 2002 on: half of the capital gain) will be taxed at regular
               income tax rates.

Special rules apply if a single shareholder holds 1% or more of the shares of
724 Solutions.

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS OFFER.

Description of Tax Consequences to Employees in the United Kingdom (other
than Scotland)

           MATERIAL U.K. (OTHER THAN SCOTLAND) INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES

            WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT
TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OFFER.

            The following is a general summary of the material U.K. income
tax consequences of the cancellation of eligible options and the grant of the
new options, pursuant to this offer applicable to the U.K. subsidiaries or
U.K. branches of subsidiaries of 724 Solutions and to those eligible
employees who are residents of the United Kingdom (other than Scotland),
excluding expatriates. This discussion is based on the applicable provisions
of the U.K. tax legislation in force on January 24, 2002, which are subject
to change.

            Eligible employees who are residents of the United Kingdom (other
than Scotland) who cancel eligible options for the grant of new options will
not be subject to U.K. income tax in respect of the cancellation. At the date
of grant of the new options, eligible employees who are residents of the
United Kingdom (other than Scotland) will not be subject to U.K. income tax
in respect of the grant.

            Upon the exercise of a new option, the optionee will be subject
to income tax on an amount equal to the "option gain", being the excess of
(i) the fair market value of the shares purchased upon such exercise, on the
date such option is exercised, over (ii) the exercise price of the shares
purchased upon such exercise. The option gain will be subject to the
optionee's marginal rates of income tax.

            National Insurance Contributions ("NIC") also apply to the option
gain. Employee NIC is currently capped so if your income is over L29,900 (for
tax year 2001/2002), no further employee NIC is payable.

            Upon any subsequent sale of such shares, a capital gain (or loss)
will crystallise, being the amount equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale of the shares and the fair market value of such shares
on the date of exercise of such shares (i.e. the exercise price plus the
element that has been subject to tax already). Depending on how long the
shares are held, "taper relief" may be available which reduces the amount of
gain subject to tax. The taxable gain is taxed at capital gains tax rates.
For the tax year 2001/2002 the first 7,500 pounds sterling of all capital

               or her to evaluate the merits and risks of such investment and
               that he or she is able to bear the economic risk of holding such
               Shares for an indefinite period;

of this Plan, Options held by the Personal Holding Corporation of an Eligible
Individual shall be considered to be held by that Eligible Individual. Any
Options held by the Personal Holding Corporation of a Participant shall
terminate and be void and of no further effect as to all Shares purchaseable
thereunder on the date which is 30 days after the date on which that Eligible
Individual ceases to Control that corporation or the date that corporation
otherwise ceases to be a Personal Holding Corporation of that Eligible
Individual, as provided in Section 16. Provided, however, that if a Personal
Holding Corporation ceases to qualify as such solely as a result of the death of
the Eligible Individual in question, such Options shall remain exercisable on
the terms and subject to the conditions set out herein as if such Options had
been held directly by the deceased MUTATIS MUTANDIS, and provided further that
such Personal Holding Corporation continues to qualify as such but for the death
of the Eligible Individual in question.

9.        EXERCISE PRICE.  Subject to Section 15, the exercise price per Share
shall be not less than the Market Price per Share on the date the grant of the
Option is approved.

10.       TERM OF OPTION.  The term of each Option shall be determined by the
Administrators, provided that no Option shall be exercisable after 10 years from
the date on which it is granted.

11.       SHARES AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.  The Shares subject to each Option
shall become available for purchase by the Participant on the date or dates
determined by the Administrators when the Option is granted.

12.       OPTION CONFIRMATION.  Upon the grant of each Option, a stock option
confirmation, substantially in the form of Schedule 2, shall be delivered by the
Administrators to the Eligible Individual in question. The stock option
confirmation shall indicate the number of Options, if any, which the Participant
has elected to have granted directly, to a Trust or Trusts, or to a Personal
Holding Corporation or Personal Holding Corporations.
<Page>

13.       EXERCISE OF OPTION.  Subject to Section 11, an Option may be exercised
at any time, or from time to time, during its term as to any number of whole
Shares which are then available for purchase; provided that no partial exercise
may be for less than 100 whole Shares, unless such exercise is with respect to
the entire Option balance held by the Participant. A Participant electing to
exercise an Option on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a Trust or Personal
Holding Corporation shall give written notice of the election to the
Administrators, substantially in the form of Schedule 3 or in any other form
acceptable to the Administrators. The aggregate amount to be paid for the Shares
to be acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall accompany the written
notice.

          Upon actual receipt by the Administrators of written notice and a
certified cheque or bank draft for the aggregate exercise price, the appropriate
number of Optioned Shares shall be issued and registered in the name of the
Participant exercising the Option (including the Trustee, in the case of the
exercise of Options by a Trust) and in issuing such Optioned Shares, the
Corporation shall be deemed to represent to the Participant exercising the
Option as of the date of such exercise that the Corporation is validly existing
under the BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT (Ontario), has not been dissolved and no
proceedings have been taken or authorized by the Corporation or by any other
person with respect to the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of the Corporation or, except as publicly disclosed, with respect to
any merger, consolidation, arrangement or reorganization relating to the
Corporation.

          Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the Plan or any Option or
Agreement, the Corporation's obligation to issue Shares to a Participant
pursuant to the exercise of any Option shall be subject to:

          (a)  completion of such registration or other qualification of such
               Shares or obtaining approval of such governmental or regulatory
               authority as the Corporation shall determine to be necessary or
               advisable in connection with the authorization, issuance or sale
               thereof;

          (b)  the admission of such Shares to listing on any stock exchange on
               which the Shares may then be listed;

          (c)  the receipt from the Optionee of such representations,
               warranties, agreements and undertakings as the Corporation
               determines to be necessary or advisable in order to safeguard
               against the violation of the securities laws of any jurisdiction;
               and

          (d)  any other reasonable procedures as prescribed by the Corporation
               from time to time.

14.       TAXATION.  The Corporation or any Affiliate may take such steps as are
considered necessary or appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which the
Corporation or the Affiliate, as the case may be, is required by any law or
regulation of any governmental authority whatsoever to withhold in connection
with any Option or Share including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the withholding of all or any portion of any payment or the
withholding of the issue of Shares to be issued upon the exercise of any Option,
until such time as the Optionee has paid the Corporation or the
<Page>

Affiliate for any amount which the Corporation or the Affiliate is required to
withhold with respect to such taxes.

15.       CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS.  Appropriate adjustments as regards Options
granted or to be granted, in the number of Shares which are available for
purchase and/or in the purchase price for such Shares under the Plan and to the
maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be made by
the Board to give effect to the number of Shares of the Corporation resulting
from subdivisions, consolidations or reclassifications of the Shares, the
payment of stock dividends by the Corporation (other than dividends in the
ordinary course) or other changes in the capital stock of the Corporation which
the Board may, in its discretion, consider relevant for purposes of ensuring
that the rights of the Participants are not prejudiced thereby (including
amalgamations, mergers, reorganizations, liquidations and similar material
transactions), subject to the approval, if required, of any stock exchange on
which the securities of the Corporation may be listed. If: (a) the Corporation
proposes to enter into a transaction contemplated in Subsection 182(1) of the
BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT (Ontario); (b) the Corporation proposes to make an
issuer bid for all or substantially all holders of shares or proposes to enter
into a merger, amalgamation or other corporate arrangement or reorganization or
to liquidate, dissolve or wind-up; (c) an offer to purchase all (or any and all)
of the outstanding shares of the Corporation is made by a third party; (d) there
occurs or is proposed a sale or transfer of all, or substantially all, of the
undertaking, property or assets of the Corporation; or (e) there occurs a
mandatory escrow or repricing of unexercised Options pursuant to a request made
by an underwriter or securities regulatory body in connection with an initial
public offering of securities of the Corporation, the Board may, with
appropriate notice and in a fair and equitable manner, determine the manner in
which all unexercised Options granted under the Plan shall be treated including,
for example, requiring the escrowing of such Options, repricing such Options'
exercise price, requiring the acceleration of the expiry time for the exercise
of all or a PRO RATA portion of such Options by the Participants and of the time
for the fulfilment of any conditions or restrictions on such exercise, and/or
declaring that each (or a PRO RATA portion of each) outstanding Option shall be
automatically vested and exercisable in full. All determinations of the Board
pursuant to this Section 15 shall be conclusive and final.

          If at any time after the grant of an Option to any Optionee and prior
to the expiration of the term of such Option, the Shares shall be reclassified,
reorganized or otherwise changed, otherwise than as specified in this Section
15, or the Corporation shall consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into
another corporation (the corporation resulting or continuing from such
consolidation, merger or amalgamation being herein called the "Successor
Corporation") the Optionee shall be entitled to receive upon the subsequent
exercise of his or her Option in accordance with the terms hereof and shall
accept in lieu of the number of Shares to which he or she was theretofore
entitled upon such exercise, but for the same aggregate consideration payable
therefor, the aggregate number of shares of the appropriate class and/or other
securities of the Corporation or the Successor Corporation (as the case may be)
and/or other consideration from the Corporation or the Successor Corporation (as
the case may be) that the Optionee would have been entitled to receive as a
result of such reclassification, reorganization or other change or
consolidation, merger or amalgamation, if on the record date of such
reclassification, reorganization or other change or the effective date of such
consolidation, merger or amalgamation, as the
<Page>

case may be, he or she had been the registered holder of the number of Shares to
which he or she was theretofore entitled upon such exercise.

16.       EFFECT OF TERMINATION ON PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN.  Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Termination, the Options granted to the relevant
Participant (including Options held by a Trust established for the benefit of
such Participant or to a Personal Holding Corporation of such Participant) may
be exercised only before the earlier of the following (the "Termination Time"):

          (a)  the close of business on the expiry date of the Option; and

          (b)  (i)  in the case of termination of the Participant's employment
                    or directorship with cause by the Corporation, the close of
                    business on the date which is thirty days following the date
                    of such termination; and

               (ii) in any other case, subject to the provisions of Section 19
                    hereof, the close of business on the expiry date of the
                    Option; provided that: (A) the Participant observes his or
                    her fiduciary duties to, and the non-competition and
                    non-solicitation provisions of his or her employment
                    contract with, the Corporation; and (B) after the expiry of
                    such non-competition and non-solicitation provisions, the
                    Participant does not become an employee of or provide
                    services to a Competitor or an Affiliate of a Competitor or
                    becomes a Competitor himself or herself. Where a Participant
                    fails to observe the requirements of either subparagraphs
                    16(b)(ii)A or 16(b)(ii)B, the Options granted to such
                    Participant shall be exercised, in each case, within thirty
                    days of the date of failing to satisfy the requirements of
                    subparagraph 16(b)(ii)A or 16(b)(ii)B, as the case may be.

                    Further, on and from the date of an Event of Termination and
                    subject to the expiry dates outlined above in this Section
                    16, a Participant may only exercise Vested Options as of the
                    close of business on the date of the Event of Termination
                    and the right to exercise Unvested Options shall cease
                    immediately on the date of the Event of Termination without
                    taking into account any notice or severance period except
                    that:

                      (i)  in the case of the death of the Participant or
                           termination of the Participant's employment by the
                           Corporation or the Participant due to permanent
                           disability of the Participant, as determined by the
                           Board acting reasonably and in good faith, a
                           Participant has the right to exercise such Unvested
                           Options which would have otherwise become Vested
                           Options during the one year period immediately
                           following the date of the Event of Termination; and
<Page>

                      (ii) in the case of termination of employment or
                           directorship by the Corporation without cause, a
                           Participant may exercise such Unvested Options which
                           would have become Vested Options during the period
                           which is the shorter of: (A) the six month period
                           commencing on the date of such termination of
                           employment; or (B) the period of notice of
                           termination of employment to which the Participant
                           was entitled at law.

17.       CHANGE OF CONTROL.  If an offer is made to purchase all of the issued
and outstanding Shares (for the purposes of this Section 17, an "Offer") and
the Board recommends acceptance of the Offer or if there is a consolidation,
merger or amalgamation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation
whereby the voting shareholders of the Corporation immediately prior to the
consolidation, merger or amalgamation receive shares entitled to exercise
less than 50% of the voting rights attaching to the voting shares of the
consolidated, merged or amalgamated corporation, including a sale whereby all
or substantially all of the Corporation's undertakings and assets become the
property of any other corporation, then a Participant shall, notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 11 hereof, immediately be entitled to exercise such Option
with respect to all of the Shares subject to the Option and not yet purchased
thereunder, provided that the Participant in fact tenders his or her Optioned
Shares to the Offer.

          In addition, if the terms of the Offer permit the tendering of
Optioned Shares by notice of guaranteed delivery or similar procedure in
order to permit the participation in such Offer of the holders of Options, a
Participant shall, notwithstanding Section 11 hereof, have the right to exercise
his or her Options (for purposes of tendering to the Offer) as to the full
amount of Optioned Shares purchasable thereunder, whether or not then vested,
conditional only upon completion of the Offer and to tender the Optioned Shares
to the Offer by notice of guaranteed delivery or similar procedure, provided
that arrangements for payment of the exercise price satisfactory to the
Corporation and in compliance with applicable law are made and the Corporation
will take all reasonable steps necessary to facilitate such conditional exercise
of Options and such tender of Optioned Shares.

18.       TRANSFERABILITY.  Options may only be exercised by the Participant
(including a Trust or Personal Holding Corporation), and upon the Participant's
death, the legal representative of his or her estate. Options are non-assignable
and, accordingly, a Participant exercising an Option may subscribe for Shares
only in his or her own name, on behalf of a Trust, in the name of his or
her Personal Holding Corporation or in his or her capacity as a legal
representative. Upon any attempt to, directly or indirectly, transfer, assign,
pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of an Option contrary to the provisions
of the Plan, or upon the levy of any attachment or similar process upon an
Option or upon the bankruptcy of a Participant, the Option shall, at the
election of the Corporation, cease and terminate and be of no further force or
effect whatsoever.

19.       CALL RIGHT.  If a Participant (in this Section 19, the "Departing
Employee") shall for any reason cease to be an employee of, or consultant to,
the Corporation, the Corporation (in this Section 19 called the "Purchaser")
shall at any time thereafter be
<Page>

entitled to send a notice in writing to the Departing Employee requiring the
sale of all of the Options beneficially owned by the Departing Employee
(in this Section 19, the "Purchased Options") and on receipt of such notice,
the Departing Employee (in this Section 19, the "Vendor") shall sell to the
Purchaser and the Purchaser shall purchase from the Vendor the Purchased
Options, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

          The purchase price for the Purchased Options shall be the then current
"in-the-money" value thereof, based on the Market Price of the underlying
Shares.

          The closing of the transaction of purchase and sale herein
contemplated shall take place at such place and time as determined by the
Administrators on the date which is the later of: (a) the date which is 15 days
after receipt by the Departing Employee of the notice contemplated in this
Section 19; and (b) the date which is 15 days after the purchase price for the
Purchased Options is finally determined in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 19.

20.       AMENDMENTS TO AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.  The provisions of this
Plan may be amended at any time and from time to time by resolution of the Board
without the consent of the Participants and the Plan, as amended, shall govern
the rights and obligations of the Corporation and the Participants with respect
to all then outstanding Options; provided that: (a) unless the change is
required by any securities commission, stock exchange or other governmental or
regulatory body of any jurisdiction to which the Plan or the Corporation now is
or hereafter becomes subject, no such action may materially and adversely affect
the rights of a Participant under any Options then outstanding without the
consent of such Participant; and (b) if required by applicable law or the rules
of any stock exchange on which the securities of the Corporation are then
listed, shareholder approval and other regulatory approval of the amended form
of the Plan is received. Pending such required approvals, additional Options may
be granted under the provisions of the Plan, as amended, provided that all such
required approvals are received prior to the issuance of any Shares of the
Corporation on the exercise of any such additional Options.

21.       TERMINATION OF PLAN.  The Board may terminate this Plan at any time in
its absolute discretion. If the Plan is so terminated, no further Options shall
be granted, but the Options then outstanding shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the provisions of this Plan.

22.       DELAY IN PROCESSING.  The Corporation will use its reasonable best
efforts to process any exercise of the vested portion of any Option within three
business days after all necessary procedures required for a valid exercise have
been complied with by the Optionee. The Corporation shall not be responsible for
any delay in responding to a valid exercise of Options due to inadvertence or
otherwise in completing the exercise procedures or for any decline in the value
of the Shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised.

23.       COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTES AND REGULATIONS.  The granting of Options and
the sale and delivery of Shares under this Plan shall be carried out in
compliance with applicable statutes and with the regulations of governmental
authorities and applicable stock exchanges. If the Administrators determine in
their discretion that, in order to comply with any such statutes or regulations,
certain action is necessary or desirable as a
<Page>

condition of, or in connection with, the granting of an Option or the issue or
purchase of Shares under an Option, that Option may not be exercised in whole or
in part unless that action shall have been completed in a manner satisfactory to
the Administrators. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the Corporation to
apply for or to obtain any required listing, registration, qualification,
consent or approval. For greater certainty, the Corporation shall not be
required to qualify for distribution the Options or the Shares purchaseable
thereunder pursuant to a prospectus or registration statement.

24.       RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT.  Nothing in the Plan or any Option shall confer
upon a Participant any right to continue or be re-elected as a director of the
Corporation or any right to continue in the employ of the Corporation or any
Affiliate, or affect in any way the right of the Corporation or any Affiliate to
terminate his or her employment at any time; nor shall anything in the Plan or
any Option be deemed or construed to constitute an agreement, or an expression
of intent, on the part of the Corporation or any Affiliate, to extend the
employment of any Optionee beyond the time at which he or she would normally be
retired pursuant to the provisions of any present or future retirement plan of
the Corporation or any Affiliate or any present or future retirement policy of
the Corporation or any Affiliate, or beyond the time at which he or she would
otherwise be retired pursuant to the provisions of any contract of employment
with the Corporation or any Affiliate.

25.       SUCCESSOR CORPORATION.  The Plan applies without any further formality
or action to any corporation resulting from the amalgamation of the Corporation
with one or more other corporations.

26.       GOVERNING LAW.  The Plan, and any and all determinations made and
actions taken in connection with the Plan, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada
applicable therein.

27.       SUBJECT TO APPROVAL.  The Plan is adopted subject to the approval of
the shareholders of the Corporation (if required by law or regulation) and any
other required regulatory approval. To the extent a provision of the Plan
requires regulatory approval which is not received, such provision shall be
severed from the remainder of the Plan until the approval is received and the
remainder of the Plan shall remain in effect.

                                    AGREEMENT

     This agreement is entered into this ____ day of __________________, 20__
between 724 Solutions Inc. (the "Corporation") and ________________________ (the
"Participant") pursuant to the stock option plan (the "Plan") adopted by the
Corporation as of September 22, 1997 and amended and restated as of February 2,
2000.

     Pursuant to the Plan and in consideration of $1.00 paid and service
provided to the Corporation by the Participant, the Corporation agrees to grant
options ("Options") and issue common shares (the "Shares") of the Corporation to
the Participant, the Trust(s) described below governed by a registered
retirement savings plan established by and for the sole benefit of the
Participant or the Personal Holding Corporation (as such term is defined in the
Plan) of the Participant in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The grant of
the Options is confirmed by the Option Confirmation attached to this agreement.

     The undersigned confirms that if the Options are granted to a Personal
Holding Corporation, such Options shall terminate immediately upon the Personal
Holding Corporation ceasing to be Controlled by the Participant or if interests
therein are granted to non-family members, as contemplated by the Plan.

     THE PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE OPTIONS ARE TERMINABLE IN
CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (INCLUDING AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 16 OF THE PLAN), THAT
THE EXPIRATION THEREOF CAN BE ACCELERATED BY THE ADMINISTRATORS IN CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES (INCLUDING AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 15 OF THE PLAN), THAT THE
CORPORATION HAS A CALL RIGHT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION
19 OF THE PLAN) AND THAT THE OPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE PLAN AS
AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME (AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 20 OF THE PLAN).

     THE GRANTING AND EXERCISE OF THE OPTION AND THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES ARE
SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PLAN, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME.

     By executing this agreement, the Participant confirms and acknowledges
that: (i) he or she has not been induced to enter into this agreement or acquire
any Option by expectation of employment or continued employment with the
Corporation; (ii) he or she has been given a copy of the Plan and has reviewed
and understands the terms thereof; and (iii) he or she has been given the
opportunity to seek independent counsel with respect to the Plan.

     This agreement shall be binding upon and enure to the benefit of the
Corporation, its successors and assigns and the Participant and the legal
representatives of his or her estate and any other person who acquires the
Participant's rights in respect of the Options by bequest or inheritance.

                           FORM OF OPTION CONFIRMATION

TO: ___________________________________ ("Participant")

     Pursuant to the stock option plan (the "Plan") adopted by 724 Solutions
Inc. (the "Corporation") as of September 22, 1997, and as amended and restated
as of February 2, 2000, and an agreement between the Corporation and the
Participant dated _______________ , the Corporation confirms the grant to the
Participant and/or the Trust(s) described below governed by a registered
retirement savings plan established by and for the sole benefit of the
Participant and/or the Personal Holding Corporation(s) Controlled by the
Participant (all as defined in the Plan) described below, of an option (the
"Option") to acquire _____ common shares (the "Shares") of the Corporation at an
exercise price of $ ________ per Share.

     Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Option shall be exercisable on or

after November 20, 2000 under the Plan as follows:

     1. PURPOSES OF THE PLAN. The purposes of this Plan are to attract and

the Administrator at the time of grant.

and sold under the Plan is 10,925,000 Shares.

        If an Option expires or becomes unexercisable without having been
exercised in full, or is surrendered pursuant to an Option Exchange Program, the
unpurchased Shares which were subject thereto shall become available for future
grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). However, Shares
that have actually been issued under the Plan, upon exercise of an Option shall
not be returned to the Plan and shall not become available for future
distribution under the Plan.

     4. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.

        (a) ADMINISTRATOR. The Plan shall be administered by the Board or a
Committee appointed by the Board, which Committee shall be constituted to comply
with Applicable Laws.

        (b) POWERS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Subject to the provisions of the Plan
and, in the case of a Committee, the specific duties delegated by the Board to
such Committee, and subject to the approval of any relevant authorities, the
Administrator shall have the authority in its discretion:

            (i) to determine the Fair Market Value;

            (ii) to select the Service Providers to whom Options may from time
to time be granted hereunder;

            (iii) to determine the number of Shares to be covered by each such
award granted hereunder;


<PAGE>
                                     - 4 -


            (iv) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;

            (v) to determine the terms and conditions, of any Option granted
hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the
exercise price, the time or times when Options may be exercised (which may be
based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture
restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Option or the
Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the
Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;

            (vi) to determine whether and under what circumstances an Option may
be settled in cash under subsection 9(e) instead of Shares;

            (vii) to reduce the exercise price of any Option to the then current
Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Shares covered by such Option
has declined since the date the Option was granted;

            (viii) to initiate an Option Exchange Program;

            (ix) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating
to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established
for the purpose of qualifying for preferred tax treatment under foreign tax
laws;

            (x) to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by
electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise
of an Option that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the
amount required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be
withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld
is to be determined. All elections by Optionees to have Shares withheld for this
purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the
Administrator may deem necessary or advisable; and

            (xi) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and awards
granted pursuant to the Plan.

        (c) EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATOR'S DECISION. All decisions, determinations
and interpretations of the Administrator shall be final and binding on all
Optionees.

     5. ELIGIBILITY.

        (a) Nonstatutory Stock Options may be granted to Service Providers.
Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees.

        (b) Each Option shall be designated in the Option Agreement as either an
Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding
such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the
Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the
first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the
Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds U.S.$100,000, such Options shall
be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 5(b),
Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they
were


<PAGE>
                                     - 5 -


granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time
the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.

        (c) Neither the Plan nor any Option shall confer upon any Optionee any
right with respect to continuing the Optionee's relationship as a Service
Provider with the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with his or her
right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time with or
without cause.

     6. TERM OF PLAN. Subject to Section 17 below, the Plan shall become
effective upon its adoption by the Board. It shall continue in effect for a term
of (10) years unless sooner terminated under Section 13 of the Plan.

     7. TERM OF OPTION. The term of each Option shall be stated in the Option
Agreement; provided, however, that the term shall be no more than ten (10) years
from the date of grant thereof. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted
to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing
more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the
Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be five (5)
years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the
Option Agreement.

     8. OPTION EXERCISE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION.

        (a) The per share exercise price for the Shares to be issued upon
exercise of an Option shall be such price as is determined by the Administrator,
but shall be subject to the following:

            (i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option

                (A) granted to an Employee who, at the time of grant of such
Option, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power
of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the
exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on
the date of grant.

                (B) granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price
shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of
grant.

            (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option

                (A) granted to a Service Provider who, at the time of grant of
such Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting
power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the
exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on
the date of grant.

                (B) granted to any other Service Provider, the per Share
exercise price shall be no less than 85% of the Fair Market Value per Share on
the date of grant.


<PAGE>
                                     - 6 -


            (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a
per Share exercise price other than as required above pursuant to a merger or
other corporate transaction.

        (b) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon
exercise of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by
the Administrator (and in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, shall be
determined at the time of grant). Such consideration may consist of (1) cash;
(2) certified, bank or cashiers check; (3) money order; (4) subject to the prior
consent of the Board or the Committee, surrender of Shares or delivery of a
properly executed form of attestation of ownership of Shares as the
Administrator may require (including withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable
upon exercise), such Shares to have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender
or attestation equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which
such Option shall be exercised (but only to the extent that such exercise would
not result in a compensation charge for financial reporting purposes with
respect to the Shares used to pay the exercise price, unless otherwise
determined by the Administrator); (5) subject to the prior consent of the Board
or the Committee, payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance procedure
(including, if approved by the Administrator and subject to regulatory approval,
a loan facility to be provided by the Company) pursuant to which an Optionee:
(x) shall provide written instructions to a Company-designated brokerage firm to
effect the immediate sale of some or all of the Shares and remit to the Company,
out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to
cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the Shares; and (y) shall provide
written directions to the Company to deliver the certificates for the Shares
directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction; or
(6) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. In making its
determination as to the type of consideration to accept, the Administrator shall
consider if acceptance of such consideration may reasonably be expected to
benefit the Company.

     9. EXERCISE OF OPTION.

        (a) PROCEDURE FOR EXERCISE; RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.

            (i) Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to
the terms hereof at such times and under such conditions as determined by the
Administrator and set forth in the Option Agreement. Unless the Administrator
provides otherwise, vesting of Options granted hereunder to Officers and
Directors shall be tolled during any unpaid leave of absence. An Option may not
be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

            (ii) An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives:
(A) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Option
Agreement and in a form approved by the Administrator from time to time in its
sole discretion) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (B) full
payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full
payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the
Administrator and permitted by the Option Agreement and the Plan.

            (iii) Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in
the name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee and approved by the
Administrator in its


<PAGE>
                                     - 7 -


sole discretion in accordance with Applicable Laws, in the name of the Optionee
and his or her spouse.

            (iv) Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate
entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the
Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a
shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares, notwithstanding the exercise
of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares
promptly after the Option is exercised.

            (v) No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for
which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as
provided in Section 11 of the Plan.

            (vi) Any right of first refusal (but not the repurchase option
applicable to unvested Shares) in favor of the Company upon exercise of an
Option or with respect to any Shares issued under the Plan shall lapse if the
Company or any successor in interest to the Company is listed on a national
securities exchange or national market system.

            (vii) Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease
in the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and
for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is
exercised.

        (b) TERMINATION OF RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER. If an Optionee
ceases to be a Service Provider, such Optionee may exercise his or her Option
within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement (of at least
thirty (30) days) to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of
termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of the Option
as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the
Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for 90 days following the
Optionee's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not
vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested
portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the
Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the
Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option
shall revert to the Plan.

        In the event an Optionee ceases to be an Employee but remains a Service
Provider, such Employee's Incentive Stock Option shall automatically convert to
a Nonstatutory Stock Option on the date 91 days following such change of status.

        (c) DISABILITY OF OPTIONEE. If an Optionee ceases to be a Service
Provider as a result of the Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his
or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Option Agreement
(of at least 180 days) to the extent the Option is vested on the date of
termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such
Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). In the absence of a specified time
in the Option Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable to the extent the
Option is vested on the date of termination for 365 days following the
Optionee's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not
vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested
portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the
Optionee does


<PAGE>
                                     - 8 -


not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option
shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

        (d) DEATH OF OPTIONEE. If an Optionee dies while a Service Provider, the
Option may be exercised within such period of time as is specified in the Option
Agreement (of at least 180 days) to the extent that the Option is vested on the
date of death (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such
Option as set forth in the Option Agreement) by the Optionee's estate or by a
person who acquires the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance.
In the absence of a specified time in the Option Agreement, the Option shall
remain exercisable to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination
for 365 days following the Optionee's termination. If, at the time of death, the
Optionee is not vested as to the entire Option, the Shares covered by the
unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan. If the
Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall
terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

        (e) BUYOUT PROVISIONS. The Administrator may at any time offer to buy
out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously granted, based on such
terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the
Optionee at the time that such offer is made.

     10. NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS. The Options may not be sold, pledged,
assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by
will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the
lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.

     11. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CERTAIN EVENTS.

        (a) CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION. Subject to any required action by the
shareholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each outstanding
Option and the number of Shares which have been authorized for issuance under
the Plan but as to which no Options have yet been granted or which have been
returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of an Option, as well as
the price per share of Shares covered by each such outstanding Option, shall be
proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued
Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
combination or reclassification of the Shares, or any other increase or decrease
in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the
Company. The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not
be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such
adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall
be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no
issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into
shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be
made with respect to, the number or price of the Shares subject to an Option.

        (b) DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION. In the event of the proposed dissolution
or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Optionee as
soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction.
The Administrator in its discretion may provide for an Optionee to have the
right to exercise his or her Option until fifteen (15) days

                                     - 9 -


prior to such transaction with respect to all Shares covered thereby, including
Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition,
the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to
any Shares purchased upon exercise of an Option shall lapse as to all such
Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time
and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously
exercised, an Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of
such proposed action.

        (c) CHANGE OF CONTROL

            (i) If an offer is made to purchase outstanding voting shares of the
Company and it is accepted and completed in respect of a sufficient number of
holders of such shares to constitute the offeror (together with such other
persons as may be considered to be "acting jointly or in concert" with the
offeror within the meaning given to such term in Section 91 of the SECURITIES
ACT (Ontario)) a shareholder of the Company entitled to exercise more than 50%
of the voting rights attached to the outstanding voting shares (provided that
prior to the offer, the offeror and such other persons (collectively, the
"Control Group") were not entitled to exercise more than 50% of the voting
rights attached to the outstanding voting shares) or if there is a
consolidation, merger or amalgamation of the Company with or into any other
corporation whereby the voting shareholders of the Company immediately prior to
the consolidation, merger or amalgamation receive shares entitled to exercise
less than 50% of the voting rights attaching to the voting shares of the
consolidated, merged or amalgamated corporation, including a sale whereby all or
substantially all of the Company's undertakings and assets become the property
of any other corporation, then Optionee shall, immediately be entitled to
exercise such Option with respect to all of the Shares subject to the Option and
not yet purchased thereunder.

            (ii) In addition, if an offer is made to purchase 50% or more of the
outstanding voting shares of the Company (the "Offer") and the terms of such
Offer permit the tendering of Shares by notice of guaranteed delivery or similar
procedure in order to permit the participation in such Offer by the holders of
Options, Optionee shall have the right to exercise his or her Options (for
purposes of tendering to the Offer) as to the full amount of Shares purchasable
thereunder whether or not then vested, conditional only upon completion of the
Offer, and to tender the Shares to be purchased from the Optionee and which are
issuable pursuant to such Options to the Offer by notice of guaranteed delivery
or similar procedure, provided that arrangements for payment of the exercise
price satisfactory to the Company and in compliance with applicable law and any
stock exchange requirements are made, and the Company will take all reasonable
steps necessary to facilitate such conditional exercise of Options and such
tender of Shares.

     12. TIME OF GRANTING OPTIONS. The date of grant of an Option shall, for all
purposes, be the date on which the Administrator makes the determination
granting such Option, or such other date as is determined by the Administrator.
Notice of the determination shall be given to each Service Provider to whom an
Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.

                                     - 10 -


     13. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.

        (a) AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. The Board may at any time amend, alter,
suspend or terminate the Plan.

        (b) SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Board shall obtain shareholder approval of
any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with
Applicable Laws.

        (c) EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION. The Plan, as amended, shall
govern the rights and obligations of the Company and Optionees with respect to
Options outstanding at such time of amendment and without further consent of any
such Optionee unless such amendment materially and adversely affects the rights
of such Optionee under any Option outstanding at such time.

     14. CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES.

        (a) LEGAL COMPLIANCE. Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the
exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and
delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further
subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such
compliance.

        (b) INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS. As a condition to the exercise of an
Option, the Administrator may require the person exercising such Option to
represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being
purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or
distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a
representation is required.

     15. INABILITY TO OBTAIN AUTHORITY. The inability of the Company to obtain
authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction (which authority is
deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale
of any Shares hereunder) shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect
of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority
shall not have been obtained.

     16. RESERVATION OF SHARES. The Company, during the term of this Plan, shall
at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

     17. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Plan shall be subject to approval by the
shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is
adopted. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the degree and manner
required under Applicable Laws.

     18. INFORMATION TO OPTIONEES AND PURCHASERS. The Company shall provide to
each Optionee and to each individual who acquires Shares pursuant to the Plan,
not less frequently than annually during the period such Optionee or purchaser
has one or more Options outstanding, and, in the case of an individual who
acquire Shares pursuant to the Plan, during the period such individual owns such
Shares, copies of annual financial statements. The Company shall not be required
to provide such statements to key employees whose duties in connection with the
Company assure their access to equivalent information.

EXERCISE AND VESTING SCHEDULE:

         This Option shall be exercisable in whole or in part, and shall vest
according to the following vesting schedule:

         The Option shall become exercisable for the Shares in four (4)
successive equal annual installments beginning with the second anniversary of
the Vesting Commencement Date, until all such shares are exercisable, subject to
Optionee's continuing to be a Service Provider on such dates.

<Page>


TERMINATION PERIOD:

         This Option may be exercised, to the extent it is then vested, for
three months after Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider. Upon death or
Disability of the Optionee, this Option may be exercised, to the extent it is
then vested, for one year after Optionee ceases to be Service Provider. In no
event shall this Option be exercised later than the Term/Expiration Date as
provided above.

II.      AGREEMENT

         1.  GRANT OF OPTION.  The Administrator of the Company hereby grants
to the Optionee named in the Notice of Grant (the "Optionee"), an option (the
"Option") to purchase the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Grant,
at the exercise price per Share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the
"Exercise Price"), and subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, which
is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 15(c) of the Plan, in
the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and this
Option Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail.

         If designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive Stock Option
("ISO"), this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option as
defined in Section 422 of the Code. Nevertheless, to the extent that it exceeds
the $100,000 rule of Code Section 422(d), this Option shall be treated as a
Nonstatutory Stock Option ("NSO").

         2.  EXERCISE OF OPTION.  This Option shall be exercisable during its
term in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of the Plan as follows:

             (a)  RIGHT TO EXERCISE.

                  (i)  Subject to subsection 2(a)(ii) below, this Option shall
be exercisable cumulatively according to the vesting schedule set forth in the
Notice of Grant.

                  (ii) This Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a
Share.

              (b)  METHOD OF EXERCISE.  This Option shall be exercisable by
delivery of an exercise notice in the form attached as EXHIBIT A unless such
other form be prescribed by the Company in accordance with the Plan (the
"Exercise Notice") which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the
number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, and such
other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company. The
Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price
as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall be deemed to be exercised upon
receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by the
aggregate Exercise Price.


                                     -2-

<Page>


         No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless
such issuance and such exercise complies with Applicable Laws. Assuming such
compliance, for income tax purposes the Shares shall be considered transferred
to the Optionee on the date on which the Option is exercised with respect to
such Shares.

         3.  OPTIONEE'S REPRESENTATIONS.  In the event the Shares have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, at the time this Option
is exercised, the Optionee shall, if required by the Company, concurrently with
the exercise of all or any portion of this Option, deliver to the Company his or
her Investment Representation Statement in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT
B.

         4.  METHOD OF PAYMENT.  Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall
be by any of the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the
Optionee:

             (a)  cash;

             (b)  certified, bank or cashiers check;

             (c)  money order;

             (d)  subject to the prior consent of the Board or the
Committee, surrender of Shares or delivery of a properly executed form of
attestation of ownership of Shares as the Administrator may require (including
withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise), such Shares to have
a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender or attestation equal to the
aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which such Option shall be
exercised (but only to the extent that such exercise would not result in a
compensation charge for financial reporting purposes with respect to the Shares
used to pay the exercise price, unless otherwise determined by the
Administrator);

              (e)  subject to the prior consent of the Board or the Committee,
payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance procedure (including, if
approved by the Administrator and subject to regulatory approval, a loan
facility to be provided by the Company) pursuant to which an Optionee: (x)
shall provide written instructions to a Company-designated brokerage firm to
effect the immediate sale of some or all of the Shares and remit to the
Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient
funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the Shares; and (y)
shall provide written directions to the Company to deliver the certificates
for the Shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale
transaction; or

              (f)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

              (g)  in making its determination as to the type of
consideration to accept, the Administrator shall consider if acceptance of such
consideration may be reasonably be expected to benefit the Company.


                                     -3-

         5.  RESTRICTIONS ON EXERCISE.  If the issuance of such Shares upon
such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such shares would
constitute a violation of any Applicable Law.

         6.  NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTION.  This Option may not be
transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or
distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by
Optionee. The terms of the Plan and this Option Agreement shall be binding
upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the
Optionee.

         7.  TERM OF OPTION.  This Option may be exercised only within the term
set out in the Notice of Grant, and may be exercised during such term only in
accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option.

         8.  TAX CONSEQUENCES.  Set forth below is a brief summary as of the
date of this Option of some of the federal tax consequences of exercise of
this Option and disposition of the Shares. THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY
INCOMPLETE, AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THE
OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER BEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR
DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.

              (a)  EXERCISE OF NSO.  There may be a regular federal income tax
liability upon the exercise of an NSO. The Optionee will be treated as having
received compensation income (taxable at ordinary income tax rates) equal to the
excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on the date of
exercise over the Exercise Price. If Optionee is an Employee or a former
Employee, the Company will be required to withhold from Optionee's compensation
or collect from Optionee and pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount
in cash equal to a percentage of this compensation income at the time of
exercise, and may refuse to honor the exercise and refuse to deliver Shares if
such withholding amounts are not delivered at the time of exercise.

              (b)  EXERCISE OF ISO.  If this Option qualifies as an ISO, there
will be no regular federal income tax liability upon the exercise of the Option,
although the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on
the date of exercise over the Exercise Price will be treated as an adjustment to
the alternative minimum tax for federal tax purposes and may subject the
Optionee to the alternative minimum tax in the year of exercise.

              (c)  EXERCISE OF ISO FOLLOWING DISABILITY.  If the Optionee
ceases to be an Employee as a result of a disability that is not a total and
permanent disability as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code, to the extent
permitted on the date of termination, the Optionee must exercise an ISO within
three months of such termination for the ISO to be qualified as an ISO.

              (d)  DISPOSITION OF SHARES.  In the case of an NSO, if Shares
are held for at least one year, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares
will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes. In
the case of an ISO, if Shares transferred pursuant to the Option are held for at
least one year after exercise and at least two years after the Date of Grant,
any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will also be treated as long-term
capital gain for federal income tax purposes. If Shares purchased under an ISO
are disposed of within one year after exercise or two


                                     -4-

<Page>


years after the Date of Grant, any gain realized on such disposition will be
treated as compensation income (taxable at ordinary income rates) to the
extent of the difference between the Exercise Price of the Exercised Shares
and the lesser of (i) the Fair Market Value of the Exercised Shares on the
date of exercise, or (ii) the sale price of the Exercised Shares. Different
rules may apply if the Shares are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture
(within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code) at the time of purchase. Any
additional gain will be taxed as capital gain, short-term depending on the
period that the ISO Shares were held.

              (e)  NOTICE OF DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITION OF ISO SHARES.  If the
Option granted to Optionee herein is an ISO, and if Optionee sells or otherwise
disposes of any of the Shares acquired pursuant to the ISO on or before the
later of (i) the date two years after the Date of Grant, or (ii) the date one
year after the date of exercise, the Optionee shall immediately notify the
Company in writing of such disposition. Optionee agrees that Optionee may be
subject to income tax withholding by the Company on the compensation income
recognized by the Optionee.

         9.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT; GOVERNING LAW.  The Plan is incorporated herein
by reference. The Plan and this Option Agreement constitute the entire
agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the
Company and Optionee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be
modified adversely to the Optionee's interest except by means of a writing
signed by the Company and Optionee. This Option Agreement is governed by the
internal substantive laws but not the choice of law rules of Texas.

         10.  NO GUARANTEE OF CONTINUED SERVICE.  OPTIONEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF SHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS
EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY
(NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF BEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THIS OPTION OR ACQUIRING
SHARES HEREUNDER). OPTIONEE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS
AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER AND THE VESTING SCHEDULE
SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE OF CONTINUED
ENGAGEMENT AS A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT
ALL, AND SHALL NOT INTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH OPTIONEE'S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY'S
RIGHT TO TERMINATE OPTIONEE'S RELATIONSHIP AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AT ANY TIME,
WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.

         Optionee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and represents that
he or she is familiar with the terms and provisions thereof, and hereby accepts
this Option subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof. Optionee has
reviewed the Plan and this Option in their entirety, has had an opportunity to
obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Option and fully
understands all provisions of the Option. Optionee hereby agrees to accept as
binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the
Administrator upon any questions arising under the Plan or this Option. Optionee
further agrees to notify the Company upon any change in the residence address
indicated below.

                       INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION STATEMENT

OPTIONEE:     NAME

COMPANY:      TANTAU SOFTWARE, INC.

SECURITY:     COMMON STOCK

AMOUNT:

DATE:

In connection with the purchase of the above-listed Securities, the undersigned
Optionee represents to the Company the following:

         (a)  Optionee is aware of the Company's business affairs and financial
condition and has acquired sufficient information about the Company to reach an
informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the Securities. Optionee is
acquiring these Securities for investment for Optionee's own account only and
not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" thereof
within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act").

         (b)  Optionee acknowledges and understands that the Securities
constitute "restricted securities" under the Securities Act and have not been
registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon a specific exemption
therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide
nature of Optionee's investment intent as expressed herein. In this connection,
Optionee understands that, in the view of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the statutory basis for such exemption may be unavailable if
Optionee's representation was predicated solely upon a present intention to hold
these Securities for the minimum capital gains period specified under tax
statutes, for a deferred sale, for or until an increase or decrease in the
market price of the Securities, or for a period of one year or any other fixed
period in the future. Optionee further understands that the Securities must be
held indefinitely unless they are subsequently registered under the Securities
Act or an exemption from such registration is available. Optionee further
acknowledges and understands that the Company is under no obligation to register
the Securities. Optionee understands that the certificate evidencing the
Securities will be imprinted with a legend which prohibits the transfer of the
Securities unless they are registered or such registration is not required in
the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company, and with any other legend
required under applicable state securities laws.

         (c)  Optionee is familiar with the provisions of Rule 701 and Rule 144,
each promulgated under the Securities Act, which, in substance, permit limited
public resale of "restricted securities"

<Page>


acquired, directly or indirectly from the issuer thereof, in a non-public
offering subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Rule 701 provides
that if the issuer qualifies under Rule 701 at the time of the grant of the
Option to the Optionee, the exercise will be exempt from registration under
the Securities Act. In the event the Company becomes subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
ninety (90) days thereafter (or such longer period as any market stand-off
agreement may require) the Securities exempt under Rule 701 may be resold,
subject to the satisfaction of certain of the conditions specified by Rule
144, including: (1) the resale being made through a broker in an unsolicited
"broker's transaction" or in transactions directly with a market maker (as
said term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934); and, in the
case of an affiliate, (2) the availability of certain public information about
the Company, (3) the amount of Securities being sold during any three month
period not exceeding the limitations specified in Rule 144(e), and (4) the
timely filing of a Form 144, if applicable. In the event that the Company does
not qualify under Rule 701 at the time of grant of the Option, then the
Securities may be resold in certain limited circumstances subject to the
provisions of Rule 144, which requires the resale to occur not less than one
year after the later of the date the Securities were sold by the Company or
the date the Securities were sold by an affiliate of the Company, within the
meaning of Rule 144; and, in the case of acquisition of the Securities by an
affiliate, or by a non-affiliate who subsequently holds the Securities less
than two years, the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in sections (1),
(2), (3) and (4) of the paragraph immediately above.

         (d)  Optionee further understands that in the event all of the
applicable requirements of Rule 701 or 144 are not satisfied, registration under
the Securities Act, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration
exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact that Rules 144
and 701 are not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
has expressed its opinion that persons proposing to sell private placement
securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to
Rules 144 or 701 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an
exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such
persons and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so
at their own risk. Optionee understands that no assurances can be given that any
such other registration exemption will be available in such event.


                                               Signature of Optionee:


                                               _________________________________

3. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

3.1 The Plan shall be administered by the Board or by any committee (the

3.2 The Board or Committee shall have the power, where consistent with the
general purpose and intent of the Plan and subject to the specific provisions of
the Plan:

     (a)  to establish policies and to adopt rules and regulations for carrying
          out the purposes, provisions and administration of the Plan;

     (b)  to interpret and construe the Plan and to determine all questions
          arising out of the Plan or any Option, and any such interpretation,
          construction or determination made by the Board or Committee shall be
          final, binding and conclusive for all purposes;

     (c)  to determine the number of Shares covered by each Option;

     (d)  to determine the Option Price of each Option in accordance with the
          provisions of the Plan;

     (e)  to determine the time or times when Options will be granted and
          exercisable;

     (f)  to determine if the Shares which are issuable on the exercise of an
          Option will be subject to any restrictions upon the exercise of such
          Option;

     (g)  to prescribe the form of the instruments relating to the grant,
          exercise and other terms of Options;


                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>

     (h)  subject to regulatory requirements, to make exceptions to the Plan in
          circumstances which the Board or Committee determine to be
          exceptional; and

     (i)  to take such other action, not inconsistent with the terms of the
          Plan, as the Board or Committee deems appropriate.

3.3 The Board or the Committee may, in its discretion, require as conditions to
the grant or exercise of any Option that the Optionee shall have:

     (a)  represented, warranted and agreed in form and substance satisfactory
          to the Corporation that he or she is acquiring and will acquire such
          Option and the Shares to be issued upon the exercise thereof or, as
          the case may be, is acquiring such Shares, for his or her own account,
          for investment and not with a view to or in connection with any
          distribution, that he or she has had access to such information as is
          necessary to enable him or her to evaluate the merits and risks of
          such investment and that he or she is able to bear the economic risk
          of holding such Shares for an indefinite period;

     (b)  agreed to restrictions on transfer in form and substance satisfactory
          to the Corporation and to an endorsement on any option agreement or
          certificate representing the Shares making appropriate reference to
          such restrictions; and

     (c)  agreed to indemnify the Corporation in connection with the foregoing.

3.4 Any Option granted under the Plan shall be subject to the requirement that,
if at any time counsel to the Corporation shall determine that the listing,
registration or qualification of the Shares subject to such Option upon any
securities exchange or under any law or regulation of any jurisdiction, or the
consent or approval of any securities exchange or any governmental or regulatory
body of any jurisdiction, is necessary as a condition of, or in connection with,
the grant or exercise of such Option or the issuance or purchase of Shares
thereunder, such Option may not be accepted or exercised in whole or in part
unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have
been effected or obtained on conditions acceptable to the Board or the
Committee. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the Corporation to apply
for or to obtain such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval;
provided however, that while the Shares are listed for trading on the TSE, the
Corporation shall give notice to the TSE of any proposed grant of Options under
the Plan and the Corporation shall not proceed with any transaction without the
prior consent of the TSE, if required. The inability of the Corporation to
obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any,
deemed by the Corporation's legal counsel to be necessary for the lawful
issuance and sale of any Shares or Options hereunder shall relieve the
Corporation of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such
securities as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
The grant of Options and the issuance of Shares upon exercise of Options shall
be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state,
provincial and foreign laws with respect to such securities. As a condition to
the exercise of any Option, the Corporation may require the Optionee to satisfy
any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance
with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty
with respect thereto as may be requested by the Corporation.

3.5 Without limiting the generality of Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 7.3 hereof, unless
a registration statement relating to the Shares covered by any Option issued in
favour of an Optionee resident in the United States of America has been filed
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and is effective on
the date of exercise (unless in the opinion of legal counsel to the Corporation
the Shares issuable upon exercise of the Option may be issued in accordance with
the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933), the exercise of the Option by such Optionee will


                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>

be contingent upon receipt from the Optionee of a representation in writing
satisfactory to the Board or the Committee that at the time of such exercise it
is the Optionee's then intention to acquire the Shares being purchased for
investment and not for resale or other distribution thereof to the public in the
United States of America. If such representation in writing is required, the
Board or the Committee may in its discretion inscribe an investment legend on
the share certificates issued pursuant to the exercise of the Option. The
issuance of Shares upon the exercise of the Option shall be subject to all
applicable laws, rules and regulations and Shares shall not be issued except
upon the approval of proper government agencies or Stock Exchanges as may be
required. Provided, however, the Option shall not be exercisable if at any date
of exercise, it is the opinion of counsel for the Corporation that registration
of the said Shares under the SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 or other applicable statute
or regulation is required and the Option shall again become exercisable only if
the Corporation elects to and thereafter effects a registration of the Shares
subject to the Option under the SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 or other applicable
statute or regulation within the term of the Option. If the Option may not be
exercised, the Corporation shall return to the Optionee, without interest or
deduction, any funds received by it in connection with the proposed exercise of
the Option.

3.6 The Board or the Committee may establish one or more separate programs under
the Plan for the purpose of issuing particular forms of Options (including
Incentive Stock Options) to one or more classes of Eligible Persons on such
terms and conditions as determined by the Board or the Committee from time to
time. For greater certainty, if the applicable taxation, corporate-commercial,
employment or other legal regime prevailing in a particular country or
jurisdiction makes it advisable, the Board or Committee may establish an
addendum or sub-plan to the Plan covering Options granted to residents of the
particular country.

4.   SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN

4.1 Options may be granted in respect of authorized and unissued Shares,
provided that the aggregate number of Shares reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of all Options granted under the Plan, subject to any adjustment of
such number pursuant to the provisions of Article 8 hereof , shall not exceed
10,500,000 (inclusive of the Tantau Incentive Options) or such greater number of
Shares as may be determined by the Board and approved by any relevant Stock
Exchange or other regulatory authority and, if required, by the shareholders of
the Corporation. Optioned Shares that are not purchased as a result of Options
having terminated or expired without being fully exercised shall not be counted
for purposes of the foregoing and shall be available for subsequent Options. No
fractional Shares may be purchased or issued under the Plan.

5.   ELIGIBILITY; GRANT; TERMS OF OPTIONS

5.1 Subject to Section 5.2, options may be granted by the Board or the Committee
to any Eligible Individual, provided that such Eligible Individual may elect,
with the prior consent of the Board or the Committee, to have some or all of any
Options which would otherwise be granted to that Eligible Individual to instead
be granted to an Eligible Investment Vehicle of such Eligible Individual. Such
election must be made prior to the execution of the share option agreement
referred to in Section 7.4 and shall be evidenced in such agreement.

5.2 Notwithstanding Sections 2.9 and 5.1, an Eligible Person shall not be
construed as such and the Plan shall be read to exclude from participation those
particular individuals or entities who are not eligible to receive Options
pursuant to the securities laws of the relevant jurisdiction, whether such
restriction relates to the nature or identity of the person, the nature of
services they provide, the entity which is proposed to hold the Option or
otherwise.

                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>

5.3 The aggregate number of Optioned Shares purchasable at any time pursuant to
outstanding Options issued to non-employee directors of the Company shall not
exceed 1% of the number of issued and outstanding Shares, determined as at the
time of the proposed Option grant. A non-employee director shall be eligible for
annual Option grants in an amount not to exceed such number of Shares as shall
be determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee having regard to
the generally prevailing practices of technology companies of similar size and
scope.

5.4 Subject as herein and otherwise specifically provided in this Article 5, the
number of Shares subject to each Option, the Option Price of each Option, the
expiration date of each Option, the extent to which each Option is exercisable
from time to time during the term of the Option and other terms and conditions
relating to each such Option shall be determined by the Board or the Committee.
The Board or the Committee may, in their entire discretion (but subject to the
consent of applicable Stock Exchanges), subsequent to the time of granting
Options hereunder, permit an Optionee to exercise any or all of the unvested
options then outstanding and granted to the Optionee under this Plan, in which
event such unvested Options then outstanding and granted to the Optionee shall
be deemed to be immediately exercisable during such period of time as may be
specified by the Board or the Committee. Provided, however, that this provision
shall not be construed so as to permit the acceleration of all or substantially
all Options outstanding under this Plan in one transaction (or as part of a
series of related transactions) in circumstances other than those contemplated
by Article 8. In addition, (i) the acceleration of the vesting of an Option
granted to a director of the Corporation pursuant to this Section 5.4; and (ii)
the re-pricing of an outstanding Option held by a director or senior officer of
the Corporation (for greater certainty, excluding adjustments specifically
contemplated in this Plan or the Option grant agreement), shall require the
consent or ratification of the Shareholders of the Corporation.

5.5 Subject to any adjustments pursuant to the provisions of Article 8 hereof,
the Option Price of any Option shall in no circumstances be lower than the
Market Price determined on the date the Option is granted. If, as and when any
Shares have been duly purchased and paid for under the terms of an Option, such
Shares shall be conclusively deemed allotted and issued as fully paid and
non-assessable Shares at the price paid therefor.

5.6 The term of an Option shall not exceed 10 years from the date of the grant
of the Option.

5.7 No Options shall be granted to any Optionee if the total number of Shares
issuable to such Optionee (including any related Eligible Investment Vehicle)
under this Plan, together with any Shares reserved for issuance to such Optionee
(including any related Eligible Investment Vehicle) under options for services
or any other stock option plans or Share Compensation Arrangements, would exceed
5% of the number of issued and outstanding Shares. Optioned Shares which are not
purchased as a result of such Options having terminated or expired without being
fully exercised shall not be counted for purposes of the foregoing.

5.8 An Option is personal to the Optionee and non-assignable (whether by
operation of law or otherwise), except as provided for herein. Upon any attempt
to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of an Option
contrary to the provisions of the Plan, or upon the levy of any attachment or
similar process upon an Option, the Option shall, at the election of the
Corporation, cease and terminate and be of no further force or effect
whatsoever.

5.9 Notwithstanding Section 5.8 hereof, subject to obtaining all required
regulatory approvals, Options (other than Incentive Stock Options) may be
transferred or assigned between an Eligible Individual and such person's
Eligible Investment Vehicle or between Eligible Investment Vehicles of such
person, provided the assignor delivers a written notice to the Corporation, in
the manner provided in the

                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>

option agreement, instrument or certificate evidencing the Options, prior to the
assignment and the Committee or the Board approves such assignment (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld).

5.10 No Options shall be granted to any Optionee if such grant could result, at
any time, in:

     (a)  the number of Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Options granted
          to Insiders or issuable to Insiders pursuant to other stock option or
          Share Compensation Arrangements exceeding 10% of the number of issued
          and outstanding Shares; or

     (b)  the issuance to Insiders, within a one-year period, of a number of
          Shares pursuant to the exercise of Options or other Share Compensation
          Arrangements exceeding 10% of the number of issued and outstanding
          Shares; or

     (c)  the issuance to any one Insider and such Insider's associates (within
          the meaning given to such term in the SECURITIES ACT (Ontario)),
          within a one-year period, of a number of Shares exceeding 5% of the
          number of issued and outstanding Shares.

For the purposes of paragraphs 5.10(b) and (c), the phrase "issued and
outstanding Shares" means the number of outstanding Shares determined
immediately prior to the proposed grant and shall be determined excluding any
Shares issued pursuant to the Plan or other Share Compensation Arrangements
during the immediately preceding year.

For the purposes of Section 5.10, entitlements under Share Compensation
Arrangements granted prior to a grantee becoming an Insider shall be excluded in
determining the number of Shares issuable to Insiders.

6.   TERMINATION OR EXTENSION OF OPTION RIGHTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

6.1 Subject to Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 or 6.6 hereof and to any specific
resolution passed by the Committee or the Board with respect to an Option, an
Option and all rights to purchase Shares pursuant thereto shall expire and
terminate immediately upon the Optionee who holds such Option ceasing to be an
Eligible Person. For greater certainty, upon an Optionee ceasing to be an
Eligible Individual, any Eligible Investment Vehicle of such Eligible Individual
shall cease to be an Eligible Person.

6.2 The Committee or the Board may, in their entire discretion (but subject to
the requirements of the TSE and any other applicable securities regulators), at
the time of the granting of Options hereunder, determine the provisions relating
to the expiry of an Option upon the bankruptcy, death, Disability, retirement,
termination of employment or directorship of an Optionee with the Corporation or
any Affiliate while such Optionee holds an Option which has not been fully
exercised. The provisions relating to such expiry shall be contained in the
written option agreement, instrument or certificate between the Corporation and
the Optionee.

6.3 For greater certainty, subject to Section 6.2 and the provisions of the
related grant agreement, Options shall not be affected by any termination of
employment of the Optionee or by the Optionee ceasing to be a director, officer
or consultant of the Corporation or an Affiliate thereof, provided that the
Optionee continues to be an Eligible Person and provided that the termination of
employment or other relationship was not for cause. For the purposes of this
Section 6.3, except if otherwise provided in the agreement evidencing the
Option, a determination by the Corporation that an Optionee was discharged or
other relationship terminated for "cause" shall be binding on the Optionee.

6.4 Except as specifically provided in a retirement or other benefit plan of the
Corporation or its Affiliate, grants of Options shall not be deemed compensation
for purposes of computing benefits or


                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>

contributions under any retirement plan of the Corporation or Affiliate, and
shall not affect any benefits under any other benefit plan of any kind or any
benefit plan subsequently instituted under which the availability or amount of
benefits is related to level of compensation. The Plan is not a "Retirement
Plan" or "Welfare Plan" under the United States Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended. Except as shall be specifically provided in
the contract of employment or contract for provision of services, the granting
of Options is at the full discretion of the Corporation and shall, therefore,
not qualify as part of the terms of employment of the Optionee. In consideration
for the grant of the Option, the Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the value
or potential value of the Option hereby granted which is forfeited as a result
of the Optionee (including, without limitation, the related Eligible Individual)
ceasing to be an Eligible Person, shall not constitute damages in respect of
loss of office or employment and no claim may be made by or on behalf of the
Optionee against the Corporation or any of its Affiliates in respect thereof.

6.5 If the exercise of an Option within the applicable time periods set forth in
the grant agreement is prevented by the provisions of applicable law (including
as contemplated in Section 3.4 hereof), the Option shall remain exercisable for
such period of time as the Board or the Committee shall determine in its
discretion, but in any event no later than the expiry date of the stated term of
the Option (the "Option Expiry Date"). Further, if a sale of Shares acquired
upon the exercise of the Option within the applicable time periods set forth in
the grant agreement would subject the Optionee to suit under Section 16(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Option shall remain exercisable until
the earliest to occur of: (i) the tenth day following the date on which a sale
of shares by the Optionee would no longer be subject to such suit; (ii) the
180th day after the Optionee's termination of employment or service; or (iii)
the Option Expiry Date.

6.6 The Board or the Committee may, (with the consent of the TSE and other
applicable securities regulators, if required) approve a deferral of the early
termination of an Option held by an Eligible Individual in the event of such
individual taking an approved leave of absence (including sick leave, military
leave or any other leave of absence approved by management of the Corporation).
Such deferral shall not exceed six months and the vesting schedule of the Option
in question shall be suspended during the term of the leave of absence. If the
individual in question resumes his or her employment or service relationship
with the Corporation or Affiliate within such six month period, then the Option
shall not be forfeited as a result of the leave of absence and the vesting
schedule shall then resume from the point at which it was suspended. For the
purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave of absence may exceed 90
days, unless re-employment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by
statute or contract, including Corporation policies.

7.   EXERCISE OF OPTIONS

7.1 Subject to the provisions of the Plan, an Option may be exercised from time
to time by delivery to the Corporation at its registered office of a written
notice of exercise in the manner provided in the option agreement, instrument or
certificate evidencing the Options addressed to the Director, Human Resources of
the Corporation specifying the number of Shares with respect to which the Option
is being exercised and, subject to such alternative procedures set out in
Section 7.2 or as may be established by the Board or the Committee, accompanied
by payment in full of the Option Price of the Shares then being purchased.
Subject to any provisions of the Plan to the contrary, certificates for such
Shares shall be issued and delivered to the Optionee within a reasonable time
following the receipt of such notice and payment.

7.2 The type of consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon the
exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Board or the Committee. In
addition to any other types of consideration the Board or Committee may
determine, the Board or Committee (if such body so determines and subject to


                                     - 8 -
<PAGE>

compliance with applicable law and the rules of applicable Stock Exchanges) is
authorized to accept as consideration for Shares issued under the Plan the
following:

     (a)  cash;

     (b)  certified cheque;

     (c)  bank draft;

     (d)  surrender of Shares or delivery of a properly executed form of
          attestation of ownership of Shares as the Board or Committee may
          require (including withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon
          exercise of the Option) which have a Market Price on the date of
          surrender or attestation equal to the aggregate Option Price of the
          Shares in respect of which the Option is exercised (but only to the
          extent that such exercise of the Option would not result in a
          compensation charge for financial reporting purposes with respect to
          the Shares used to pay the exercise price, unless otherwise determined
          by the Board or Committee);

     (e)  payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance procedure
          (including, if approved by the Board and subject to regulatory
          approval, a loan facility to be provided by the Corporation) pursuant
          to which the Optionee: (i) shall provide written instructions to a
          Corporation-designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of
          some or all of the purchased Shares and remit to the Corporation, out
          of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient
          funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased
          Shares; and (ii) shall provide written directions to the Corporation
          to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares directly to such
          brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction; or

     (f)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

The Board or the Committee may at any time or from time to time, by approval of
or by amendment to the standard forms of Option agreement contemplated herein,
or by other means, grant Options which do not permit all of the foregoing forms
of consideration to be used in payment of the exercise price or which otherwise
restrict one or more forms of payment.

Unless the Board or Committee determines otherwise, cash, certified cheques and
bank drafts provided by Optionees who are resident Canadians as consideration
for Shares shall be denominated in Canadian dollars; cash, certified cheques and
bank drafts provided by all other Optionees may be denominated in U.S. dollars
or Canadian dollars. The Board or the Committee may prescribe one or more
published exchange rates for use in connection with exercises using a currency
other than the one specified in the grant agreement.

7.3 Notwithstanding any of the provisions contained in the Plan or in any
Option, the Corporation's obligation to issue Shares to an Optionee pursuant to
the exercise of any Option shall be subject to:

     (a)  completion of such registration or other qualification of such Shares
          or obtaining approval of such governmental or regulatory authority as
          the Corporation shall determine to be necessary or advisable in
          connection with the authorization, issuance or sale thereof;


                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>

     (b)  the admission of such Shares to listing on any Stock Exchange on which
          the Shares may then be listed;

     (c)  the receipt from the Optionee of such representations, warranties,
          agreements and undertakings, as the Corporation determines to be
          necessary or advisable in order to safeguard against the violation of
          the securities laws of any jurisdiction; and

     (d)  the satisfaction of any conditions on exercise prescribed pursuant to
          Article 3 hereof.

7.4 Options shall be evidenced by a share option agreement, instrument or
certificate in such form not inconsistent with this Plan as the Committee or the
Board may from time to time determine.

8.   CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS

8.1 Appropriate adjustments as regards Options granted or to be granted, in the
number of Shares which are available for purchase and/or in the purchase price
for such Shares under the Plan and to the maximum number of Shares available for
issuance under the Plan shall be made by the Board or the Committee to give
effect to the number of Shares of the Corporation resulting from subdivisions,
consolidations or reclassifications of the Shares, the payment of stock
dividends by the Corporation (other than dividends in the ordinary course) or
other changes in the capital stock of the Corporation which the Board or the
Committee may, in its discretion, consider relevant for purposes of ensuring
that the rights of the Optionees are not prejudiced thereby (including
amalgamations, mergers, reorganizations, liquidations and similar material
transactions), subject to the approval, if required, of any Stock Exchange on
which the securities of the Corporation may be listed.

8.2 If: (a) the Corporation proposes to enter into a transaction contemplated in
Subsection 182(1) of the BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT (Ontario); (b) the
Corporation proposes to make an issuer bid for all or substantially all holders
of shares or proposes to enter into a merger, amalgamation or other corporate
arrangement or reorganization or to liquidate, dissolve or wind-up; (c) an offer
to purchase all or substantially all of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation is made by a third party; or (d) there occurs or is proposed a sale
or transfer of all, or substantially all, of the undertaking, property or assets
of the Corporation, the Board may, with appropriate notice and in a fair and
equitable manner, determine the manner in which all unexercised Option rights
granted under the Plan shall be treated including, for example, requiring the
acceleration of the expiry time for the exercise of such rights by the Optionees
and of the time for the fulfilment of any conditions or restrictions on such
exercise, and/or declaring that each outstanding Option shall be automatically
vested and exercisable in full. All determinations of the Board pursuant to this
Section 8.2 (including a determination that it would be appropriate not to make
an adjustment in the circumstances) shall be conclusive and final.

8.3 If at any time after the grant of an Option to any Optionee and prior to the
expiration of the term of such Option: (i) the Shares shall be reclassified,
reorganized or otherwise changed, otherwise than as specified in Section 8.1; or
(ii) subject to the provisions of Section 8.2 and Article 9 hereof, the
Corporation shall consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into another
corporation (the corporation resulting or continuing from such consolidation,
merger or amalgamation being herein called the "Successor Corporation"), the
Optionee shall be entitled to receive upon the subsequent exercise of his or her
Option in accordance with the terms hereof and shall accept in lieu of the
number of Shares to which he or she was theretofore entitled upon such exercise,
but for the same aggregate consideration payable therefor, the aggregate number
of shares of the appropriate class and/or other securities of the Corporation or
the Successor Corporation (as the case may be) and/or other consideration from
the Corporation or the Successor Corporation (as the case may be) that the
Optionee would have been entitled to receive as a result of such
reclassification, reorganization or other change or, subject to the provisions
of Article 9

                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>

hereof, as a result of such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, if on the
record date of such reclassification, reorganization or other change or the
effective date of such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, as the case may
be, he or she had been the registered holder of the number of Shares to which
he or she was theretofore entitled upon such exercise.

9.   CHANGE OF CONTROL

9.1 If an offer is made to purchase outstanding voting shares of the
Corporation and it is accepted and completed in respect of a sufficient
number of holders of such shares to constitute the offeror (together with
such other persons as may be considered to be "acting jointly or in concert"
with the offeror within the meaning given to such term in Section 91 of the
SECURITIES ACT (Ontario)) a shareholder of the Corporation entitled to
exercise more than 50% of the voting rights attached to the outstanding
voting shares (provided that prior to the offer, the offeror and such other
persons (collectively, the "Control Group") were not entitled to exercise
more than 50% of the voting rights attached to the outstanding voting shares)
or if there is a consolidation, merger or amalgamation of the Corporation
with or into any other corporation whereby the voting shareholders of the
Corporation immediately prior to the consolidation, merger or amalgamation
receive shares entitled to exercise less than 50% of the voting rights
attaching to the voting shares of the consolidated, merged or amalgamated
corporation, including a sale whereby all or substantially all of the
Corporation's undertakings and assets become the property of any other
corporation, then an Optionee shall, notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 3.2(e) and Section 5.4 hereof and the written option agreements,
instruments or certificates evidencing such Option, immediately be entitled
to exercise such Option with respect to all of the Shares subject to the
Option and not yet purchased thereunder.

        In addition, if an offer is made to purchase 50% or more of the
outstanding voting shares of the Corporation (the "Offer") and the terms of
such Offer permit the tendering of Shares by notice of guaranteed delivery or
similar procedure in order to permit the participation in such Offer by the
holders of Options, an Optionee shall, notwithstanding Section 3.2(e) and
Section 5.4 hereof and the written option agreements, instruments or
certificates evidencing such Option, have the right to exercise his or her
Options (for purposes of tendering to the Offer) as to the full amount of
Shares purchasable thereunder whether or not then vested, conditional only
upon completion of the Offer, and to tender the Shares to be purchased from
the Optionee and which are issuable pursuant to such Options to the Offer by
notice of guaranteed delivery or similar procedure, provided that
arrangements for payment of the exercise price satisfactory to the
Corporation and in compliance with applicable law and Stock Exchange
requirements are made and the Corporation will take all reasonable steps
necessary to facilitate such conditional exercise of Options and such tender
of Shares.

10.  AMENDMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF THE PLAN

10.1 The Board may amend the Plan at any time and from time to time without
the consent of the Optionees, and the Plan, as amended, shall govern the
rights and obligations of the Corporation and the Optionees with respect to
all then outstanding Options; provided that: (a) unless the change is
required by any securities commission, Stock Exchange or other governmental
or regulatory body of any jurisdiction to which the Plan or the Corporation
now is or hereafter becomes subject, no such action may materially and
adversely affect the rights of an Optionee under any Options then outstanding
without the consent of such Optionee; and (b) if required by applicable law
or the rules of any Stock Exchange on which the securities of the Corporation
are then listed, shareholder approval and other regulatory approval of the
amended form of the Plan is received. Pending such required approvals,
additional Options may be granted under the provisions of the Plan, as
amended, provided that all such required approvals are received prior to the
issuance of any Shares of the Corporation on the exercise of any such
additional Options.

                                     - 11 -
<PAGE>

10.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 10, should changes be
required to the Plan by any securities commission, Stock Exchange or other
governmental or regulatory body of any jurisdiction to which the Plan or the
Corporation now is or hereafter becomes subject, such changes shall be made
to the Plan as are necessary to conform with such requirements and, if such
changes are approved by the Board, the Plan, as amended, shall be filed with
the records of the Corporation and shall remain in full force and effect in
its amended form as of and from the date of its adoption by the Board.

10.3 The Board may suspend or terminate this Plan or any portion of it at any
time in accordance with applicable legislation, and subject to any required
regulatory or shareholder approval.

10.4 Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, no suspension or termination
may, without the consent of the affected Optionee, alter or impair any
Option, or any right pursuant thereto, granted previously to any Eligible
Person.

10.5 If this Plan is terminated, the provisions of this Plan and any
administrative guidelines and other rules adopted by the Board or the
Committee which are in force at the time this Plan is terminated, will
continue in effect as long as any Option, or any right pursuant thereto,
remains outstanding. However, notwithstanding the termination of this Plan,
the Board or the Committee may make amendments to this Plan, or to any
Option, that they would be entitled to make if this Plan were still in effect.

11.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

11.1 An Optionee shall not have any rights as a shareholder of the Corporation
with respect to any of the Shares covered by such Option until the date of
issuance of the Share on the records of the Corporation maintained by its
Registrar and Transfer Agent upon the exercise of such Option, in full or in
part, and then only with respect to the Shares being issued. Without in any way
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no adjustment shall be made for
dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such
Shares are issued.

11.2 Nothing in the Plan or any Option shall confer upon an Optionee any right
to continue or be re-elected as a director, officer or consultant of, or any
right to continue in the employ of the Corporation any Affiliate, or affect in
any way the right of the Corporation or any Affiliate to terminate his or her
employment or to terminate any contract of service at any time; nor shall
anything in the Plan or any Option be deemed or construed to constitute an
agreement, or an expression of intent, on the part of the Corporation or any
Affiliate, to extend the employment of, or extend the term of an agreement with,
any Optionee beyond the time which he or she would normally be retired pursuant
to the provisions of any present or future retirement plan of the Corporation or
any Affiliate or any present or future retirement policy of the Corporation or
any Affiliate or beyond the time at which he or she would otherwise be retired
pursuant to the provisions of any contract of employment with the Corporation or
any Affiliate.

11.3 A valid exercise of an Option is subject to other reasonable procedures as
prescribed by the Corporation from time to time.

11.4 The Corporation or any Affiliate may take such steps as are considered
necessary or appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which the Corporation
or the Affiliate, as the case may be, is required by any law or regulation of
any governmental authority whatsoever to withhold in connection with any Option
or Share including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
withholding of all or any portion of any payment or the withholding of the issue
of Shares to be issued upon the exercise of any Option, until such time as the
Optionee has paid the Corporation or the Affiliate for any amount which the
Corporation or the Affiliate is required to withhold with respect to such taxes.



                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

11.5 The Corporation will use its reasonable best efforts to process any
exercise of the vested portion of any Option within three business days after
all necessary procedures required for a valid exercise have been complied with
by the Optionee. The Corporation shall not be responsible for any delay in
responding to a valid exercise of Options due to inadvertence or otherwise in
completing the exercise procedures or for any decline in value of the Shares in
respect of which the Option is being exercised.

11.6 The Plan and all matters to which reference is made herein shall be
governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of
Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein. Provided, however, that where
indicated in the Option grant agreement or required as a matter of employment
law in the jurisdiction of the Optionee (the "Foreign Jurisdiction"), the
concept of "cause" shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the Foreign
Jurisdiction. The Optionee by virtue of accepting the Option submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Province of Ontario with respect to
any interpretation or dispute or other action or proceeding with respect to the
Plan.

12.  SHAREHOLDER AND REGULATORY APPROVAL; TERM

12.1 The Plan shall be subject to ratification by the shareholders of the
Corporation to be effected by a resolution passed at a meeting of the
shareholders of the Corporation, and to acceptance by the TSE and any other
relevant regulatory authority. Any Options granted prior to such ratification
and acceptance shall be conditional upon such ratification and acceptance being
given and no such Options may be exercised unless and until such ratification
and acceptance are given.

12.2 Once effective, the Plan shall replace all other stock option plans of the
Corporation then in effect, provided that no options issued and outstanding
under such plans shall be affected by such replacement and such options shall
continue to be governed by the terms of the plans under which they were issued.

12.3 Amended and restated effective as of March 12, 2001.

1.01     ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM

The 724 Solutions  Inc. 2000 United States  Incentive  Stock Option Program
(the "Program")  is adopted  pursuant to Section 3.6 of the 724  Solutions

to attract and retain  Employees  (defined  below) who are citizens or
residents of the United States (including its territories,  possessions and
all areas subject to its jurisdiction) ("U.S. Employees") through a program
of Incentive Stock Option grants.

1.03     EFFECTIVE DATE OF PROGRAM

The Program is effective as of the effective date of the Plan.

                                   ARTICLE II
                                   DEFINITIONS


Capitalized  terms in this Program,  unless otherwise  defined herein,  have the
meaning given to them in the Plan.

2.01     "EMPLOYEE"  means an Eligible  Person as contemplated by section 2.9
         of the  Plan who is an  officer  or  employee  of the  Corporation
         or any Subsidiary.

2.02     "PARENT"  means any  corporation  (other  than the  Corporation)  in
         an unbroken chain of corporations or incorporated entities ending
         with the Corporation  if, at the time of the  granting  of the
         Incentive  Stock Option,  each of the corporations other than the
         Corporation owns stock possessing  50% or more  of the  total
         combined  voting  power  of all classes  of  stock in one of the
         other  corporations  or  incorporated entities in such chain.

2.03     "SUBSIDIARY"  means any corporation  (other than the Corporation) in

                                  OPTION TERMS


3.04     ELIGIBLE OPTIONEES

Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to U.S. Employees.  Any Optionee
who is not a U.S. Employee will be ineligible to receive Incentive Stock
Options but will be permitted to receive  Non-qualified  Stock Options.  Any
director of the Corporation  or an Affiliate who is a U.S.  Employee shall be
ineligible to vote upon the granting of an Option to themselves.

3.05     DESIGNATION AND VESTING

Each  Incentive  Stock Option  shall be so  designated  in the grant
agreement. However,  notwithstanding  such  designation,  to the extent that
the  aggregate Market Price of Shares subject to options  designated as
Incentive Stock Options which become  exercisable  for the first time by an
Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the  Corporation or any
Parent or  Subsidiary)  exceeds U.S. $100,000,  such excess Options, to the
extent of the Shares covered thereby in excess of the foregoing  limitation,
shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options.  For this purpose,
Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which
they were  granted,  and the  Market  Price of the Shares shall be
determined  as of the date the Option  with  respect to such Shares is
granted.

3.06     EXERCISE PRICE

In the case of an Incentive  Stock Option (a) granted to an Employee who, at
the time of the grant of such Incentive  Stock Option owns stock
representing  more than ten  percent  (10%) of the  voting  power  of all
classes  of stock of the Corporation or any Parent or  Subsidiary,  the per
Share exercise price shall be not less than one hundred ten  percent  (110%)
of the Market  Price per Share on the date of grant or (b) granted to any
U.S. Employee other than a U.S. Employee described in the preceding
subsection, the per Share exercise price shall be not less than one hundred
percent  (100%) of the Market Price per Share on the date of grant.

3.07     TERM

The term of an Incentive  Stock Option shall be no more than ten (10) years
from the date of grant  thereof.  However,  in the case of an Incentive
Stock Option granted to a U.S.  Employee  who, at the time the Option is
granted,  owns stock representing  more than ten percent  (10%) of the voting
power of all classes of stock of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary,
 the term of the Incentive Stock  Option  shall be five (5) years  from the
date of grant  thereof  or such shorter term as may be provided in the grant
agreement.

3.08     TRANSFERABILITY

Incentive  Stock  Options  may not be  sold,  pledged,  assigned,
hypothecated, transferred,  or disposed of in any manner  other than by will
or by the laws of descent  or  distribution  and may be  exercised,  during
the  lifetime  of the Optionee,  only  by the  Optionee;  provided  however,
that  the  Optionee  may designate a beneficiary of the Optionee's Incentive
Stock Option in the event of the Optionee's death on a beneficiary
designation form provided by the Board or Committee.

3.09     STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL

The grant of Incentive  Stock  Options  under the Plan and the Program  shall

Ontario.  The Board or Committee may grant Incentive Stock Options under the
Program prior to approval of the Plan by the stockholders,  but until such

   REVISED ARTICLE 9 OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED 2000 STOCK OPTION PLAN OF 724
  SOLUTIONS INC. WITH EFFECT FOR NEW OPTION GRANTS COMMENCING JANUARY 23, 2002

"9.  CHANGE OF CONTROL

9.1 If an offer is made to purchase outstanding voting shares of the Corporation
and it is accepted and completed (in this Article 9, an "Offer") in respect of a
sufficient number of holders of such shares to constitute the offeror (together
with such other persons as may be considered to be "acting jointly or in
concert" with the offeror within the meaning given to such term in Section 91 of
the SECURITIES ACT (Ontario)) a shareholder of the Corporation entitled to
exercise more than 50% of the voting rights attached to the outstanding voting
shares (provided that prior to the offer, the offeror and such other persons
(collectively, the "Control Group") were not entitled to exercise more than 50%
of the voting rights attached to the outstanding voting shares) or if there is a
consolidation, merger or amalgamation of the Corporation with or into any other
corporation whereby the voting shareholders of the Corporation immediately prior
to the consolidation, merger or amalgamation receive shares entitled to exercise
less than 50% of the voting rights attaching to the voting shares of the
consolidated, merged or amalgamated corporation (in this Article 9, a "Merger"),
including a sale whereby all or substantially all of the Corporation's
undertakings and assets become the property of any other corporation (an "Asset
Sale"), then an Optionee shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.2(e)
and Section 5.4 hereof and the written option agreements, instruments or
certificates evidencing such Option, be entitled to exercise such Option with
respect to all of the Shares subject to the Option and not yet purchased
thereunder:

     (I)  with respect to Options granted prior to January 23, 2002,
          immediately; and

     (II) with respect to Options granted on or after January 23, 2002:

     (a)  In the case of an Asset Sale or a Merger or in the case of an Offer
          resulting (directly or through a multi-stage transaction) in the
          acquisition of all of the outstanding Shares: as of the first
          anniversary of the completion of the Asset Sale, Merger or Offer in
          question (in this Article 9, a "Transaction"), or earlier in the
          circumstances contemplated in clause (a) or clause (b) of Section 9.2
          hereof; or

     (b)  In the case of an Offer contemplated in Section 9.1 not resulting in
          the acquisition of all of the Shares: as of the first anniversary of
          the completion of the Transaction in question, or earlier in the
          circumstances contemplated in clause (b) of Section 9.2 hereof;

     provided that, for greater certainty, during the one year period
     contemplated by this Section 9.1(II), the pre-existing vesting schedule of
     such Options shall continue to run in accordance with their terms and the
     other terms of this Plan (i.e. additional Shares might vest at various
     times during such one year period).

9.2 For purposes of Section 9.1(II), upon the occurrence of a Transaction, the
Optionee shall be entitled to exercise such Option with respect to all of the
Shares subject to the


<PAGE>

Option and not yet purchased thereunder if: (a) for purposes of Section 9.1
(II)(a), any successor to the Corporation, or the purchaser of its assets in the
case of an Asset Sale, (or, in either case, a holding body corporate thereof)
fails to assume and agree to perform the Corporation's obligations under the
Optionee's stock option agreements; or (b) for purposes of Section 9.1 (II) (a)
and (b), in the case of an Asset Sale the Optionee is not offered employment by
the purchaser (or a holding body corporate or subsidiary thereof) on
substantially the same terms and conditions as currently enjoyed, or in the case
of any Transaction the Optionee thereafter is "Involuntarily Terminated" prior
to the first anniversary of the Transaction. For greater certainty, if the
Optionee's continuous status as an Eligible Person under this Plan terminates by
reason of the Optionee's voluntary resignation (and not Involuntary Termination)
or termination for Cause, in either case prior to such time as accelerated
vesting occurs as provided in 9.1(II) hereof, then the Optionee shall not be
entitled to receive accelerated vesting under 9.1(II) hereof.


9.3 For purposes of Section 9.2, but subject to any specific provisions of the
Corporation's stock option grant agreements or sub-plans authorized hereunder,
"Involuntarily Terminated" shall mean (i) a termination by the Corporation or
its subsidiary (including its successor or other new employer as contemplated by
Section 9.2 hereof) (collectively, the "Employer") of the Optionee's employment
or other relationship with the Corporation and related Employers other than for
Cause (as defined in this Section 9); (ii) a material reduction of or variation
in the Optionee's duties, authority or responsibilities, relative to the
Optionee's duties, authority or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior
to such reduction or variation; (iii) a reduction by the Employer in the base
salary of the Optionee as in effect immediately prior to such reduction; (iv) a
material reduction by the Employer in the kind or level of employee benefits,
including bonuses, to which the Optionee was entitled immediately prior to such
reduction) with the result that the Optionee's overall benefits package is
materially reduced; or (v) the relocation of the Optionee to a facility or a
location more than thirty (30) miles from the Optionee's then present location.
For the purposes of this Section 9.3, except if otherwise provided in the
agreement evidencing the Option, a determination by the Corporation that an
Optionee was Involuntarily Terminated or not shall be binding on the Optionee.
The Optionee shall be deemed to have consented to any such event or condition
described in this Section 9.3, and not be deemed to have been Involuntarily
Terminated as a result of such event or condition, unless the Optionee provides
written notice of the Optionee's non-acquiescence within 30 days of the
effective time of such event or condition.


9.4 For purposes of Section 9.3, but subject to any specific provisions of the
Corporation's stock option grant agreements or sub-plans authorized hereunder,
"Cause" shall mean: (i) any willful act of personal dishonesty, fraud or
misrepresentation taken by the Optionee in connection with his or her
responsibilities as an employee which was intended to result in substantial gain
or personal enrichment of the Optionee at the expense of the Corporation and was
materially and demonstrably injurious to the Corporation; (ii) the Optionee's
conviction of a felony on account of any act which was materially and
demonstrably injurious to the Corporation; or (iii) the Optionee's willful and
continued failure to substantially perform his or her principal duties and
obligations of employment (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity
due to physical or mental illness), which failure is not remedied in a
reasonable period of time after receipt of written notice from the Corporation.
For the purposes


<PAGE>

of this Section 9.4, no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful"
unless done or omitted to be done in bad faith and without reasonable belief
that the act or omission was in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION 9.4, EXCEPT IF OTHERWISE PROVIDED
IN THE AGREEMENT EVIDENCING THE OPTION, A DETERMINATION BY THE CORPORATION THAT
AN OPTIONEE WAS DISMISSED FOR CAUSE SHALL BE BINDING ON THE OPTIONEE.

9.5 In addition, if an Offer is made and the terms of such Offer permit the
tendering of Shares by notice of guaranteed delivery or similar procedure in
order to permit the participation in such Offer by the holders of Options, an
Optionee shall, notwithstanding Section 3.2(e) and Section 5.4 hereof and the
written option agreements, instruments or certificates evidencing such Option,
have the right to exercise his or her Options (for purposes of tendering to the
Offer) as to the number of Shares purchasable thereunder, to the extent then
vested or to become vested on completion of the Offer, conditional only upon
completion of the Offer, and to tender the Shares to be purchased from the
Optionee and which are issuable pursuant to such Options to the Offer by notice
of guaranteed delivery or similar procedure, provided that arrangements for
payment of the exercise price satisfactory to the Corporation and in compliance
with applicable law and Stock Exchange requirements are made and the Corporation
will take all reasonable steps necessary to facilitate such conditional exercise
of Options and such tender of Shares.

9.6 For the purposes of this Article 9, an Option shall be considered assumed by
a successor corporation (or purchaser, in the case of an asset sale) or a
holding body corporate thereof if, as determined by the Board, contractual and
other arrangements are entered into (or the operation of Section 8.3 hereof
creates a similar result) such that, following the Transaction, the option or
right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Optioned Share
immediately prior to the Transaction, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or
other securities or property) received in the Transaction by holders of Shares
for each Share held on the effective date of the Transaction (and if holders
were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares, as determined by the Board);
provided, however, that if such consideration received in the Transaction is not
solely fully-participating shares of the successor corporation or a holding body
corporate thereof, the Board may, with the consent of the successor corporation,
provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option for
each Optioned Share, to be solely fully-participating shares of the successor
corporation or a holding body corporate equal in fair market value to the per
share consideration received by holders of Shares in the Transaction. Any
decisions of the Board pursuant to this Article 9 shall be made in its
discretion and shall be binding on Plan participants.


9.7 In the event of a Transaction contemplated by this Article 9, the Board may,
in addition, with appropriate notice and in a fair and equitable manner,
determine the manner in which all unexercised Option rights granted under the
Plan shall be treated including, for example, requiring the acceleration of the
expiry time for the exercise of such rights by the Optionees and of the time for
fulfillment of any conditions or restrictions on such exercise.

9.8 In the event of the assumption of this Plan as contemplated in Section 9.6,
the definition of "Corporation", "Shares", and other terms of this Plan will be
construed to reflect the appropriate entity and security resulting from the
assumption and the Plan may be amended and restated accordingly.

     THIS 724 SOLUTIONS STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT made as of the - day of -, 2001.

B E T W E E N:

                                       724 SOLUTIONS INC., a company amalgamated
                                       under the laws of the
                                       Province of Ontario,
                                       (hereinafter called the "Company")

                                                               OF THE FIRST PART

                                       - and -

                                       NAME

                                       (hereinafter called the "Optionee")

                                                              OF THE SECOND PART

     WHEREAS the Optionee is a U.S. Employee eligible to participate in the 724
Solutions Inc. 2000 United States Incentive Stock Option Program, a copy of
which is attached hereto as Schedule A (the "Program");

     AND WHEREAS the Company has determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company to grant to the Optionee an option to purchase common shares of the
Company as a performance incentive upon the terms and conditions contained
herein;

     NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that in consideration of the mutual
covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.   DEFINED TERMS

     All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the same
meaning as in the 724 Solutions Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan and the Program
authorized under Section 3.6 of such Plan, all as amended from time to time
(collectively, the "Plan"). All references herein to the Plan shall be deemed to
include a reference to the terms of the Plan as amended from time to time.

2.   COMMON SHARE PURCHASE OPTION

     Subject to the terms hereof and the provisions of the Plan, the Company
hereby grants to the Optionee an irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase
up to - Shares (hereinafter collectively called the "Optioned Shares") at the
purchase price of U.S. $- per Share.
<PAGE>

                                      - 2 -


     THIS OPTION IS INTENDED TO HAVE THE TAX STATUS OF AN INCENTIVE STOCK
OPTION. This Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option within the
meaning of Section 422(b) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), but the Company does not represent or warrant that this
Option qualifies as such. The Optionee should consult with the Optionee's own
tax advisor regarding the tax effect of this Option and the requirements
necessary to obtain favourable income tax treatment under Section 422 of the
Code, including, but not limited to, holding period requirements. (NOTE TO
OPTIONEE: If the Option is exercised more than three (3) months after the date
on which you cease to be a U.S. Employee (other than by reason of your death or
permanent and total disability as defined Section 22(e)(3) of the Code), the
Option will be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock Option and not as an Incentive
Stock Option to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code.)

     INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION FAIR MARKET VALUE LIMITATION. To the extent that
this Option (together with all Incentive Stock Options granted to the Optionee
under all stock option plans of the Company or any Subsidiary or Parent,
including the Plan) becomes exercisable for the first time during any calendar
year for Shares having a Fair Market Value (as defined below) greater than One
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (U.S. $100,000), the portion of such
Option which exceeds such amount will be treated as a Non-Qualified Stock
Option. For purposes of this Section 2, options designated as Incentive Stock
Options are taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the
Fair Market Value of Shares is determined as of the date the option with respect
to such Shares is granted. If the Code is amended to provide for a different
limitation from that set forth in this Section 2, such different limitation
shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date required or
permitted by such amendment to the Code. If this Option is treated as an
Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Non-Qualified Stock Option in part by
reason of the limitation set forth in this Section 2, the Optionee may designate
which portion of such Option the Optionee is exercising. In the absence of such
designation, the Optionee shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock
Option portion of the Option first. Separate certificates representing each such
portion shall be issued upon the exercise of the Option. No Incentive Stock
Option shall be granted to an Optionee if, at the time the Option is granted,
such Optionee owns shares possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total
combined voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or of its Parent
or a Subsidiary, unless (i) at the time such Option is granted the Option
exercise price is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market
Value of the Shares subject to the Option and (ii) such Option by its terms is
not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date of grant. (NOTE
TO OPTIONEE: If the aggregate exercise price of the Option (that is, the
exercise price multiplied by the number of Optioned Shares) plus the aggregate
exercise price of any other Incentive Stock Options you hold (whether granted
pursuant to the Plan or any other stock option plan of the Company or any
Subsidiary) is greater than U.S. $100,000, you should contact the Director,
Human Resources of the Company to ascertain whether the entire Option qualifies
as an Incentive Stock Option.)

                                      - 3 -


     FAIR MARKET VALUE. In this Agreement, "Fair Market Value" shall mean as of
any specified date, the closing price of the Shares of the Company on the TSE or
The NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. (or if the Shares of the Company are not listed on
such exchanges, such other national securities exchange on which the Shares are
then listed) on that date, or if no prices are reported on that date, on the
last preceding date on which such prices of the Shares are still reported. If
the Shares of the Company are not then listed on any national securities
exchange but are traded over the counter at the time the determination of its
Fair Market Value is required to be made hereunder, its Fair Market Value shall
be deemed to be equal to the average between the reported high and low sales
prices of the Shares of the Company on the most recent date on which the Shares
were publicly traded. If the Shares of the Company are not publicly traded at
the time a determination of its value is required to be made hereunder, the
determination of its Fair Market Value shall be made by the Board or Committee
in such manner as it deems appropriate (such determination will be made in
good-faith as required by section 422(c)(1) of the Code and may be based on the
advice of an independent investment banker or appraiser recognized to be an
expert in making such evaluations).

3.   OPTION TERM

     Subject to the vesting rules contained in Section 4 hereof, the Option
hereby granted may be exercised with respect to all or any part of the Optioned
Shares at any time or from time to time prior to the earlier of:

     (i)   the close of business on - (the "Expiry Date"); or

     (ii)  such earlier termination time as may be prescribed by the
           provisions of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 hereof or pursuant to the
           Plan.

     At the time of termination, as prescribed by the immediately preceding
sentence, the Option hereby granted shall forthwith expire and terminate and be
of no force or effect whatsoever as to such of the Optioned Shares in respect of
which the Option hereby granted has not then been exercised.

4.   VESTING

     Subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof and the Plan, the Option
hereby granted shall not be exercisable (and no Optioned Shares shall be
purchasable pursuant hereto) prior to - (the "Commencement Date").

     During the balance of the term of the Option (as prescribed by Section 3
hereof), the Optionee may purchase up to but not exceeding:

     (i)   - Shares at any time after the Commencement Date;

     (ii)  an additional - Shares at any time after the first anniversary of
           the Commencement Date; and
<PAGE>

                                      - 4 -


     (iii) an additional - Shares at any time after the second anniversary of
           the Commencement Date.

PROVISIONS TO BE ADAPTED FOR VARIOUS VESTING PERIODS.

     If the Optionee shall, during any such year, not exercise his or her right
to purchase all of the Optioned Shares purchasable during such year, then the
Optionee shall have the right, at any time or from time to time thereafter but
prior to the expiry of the Option (as prescribed by Section 3 hereof), to
purchase the Optioned Shares which were purchasable but not purchased by him or
her during the particular year.

     For greater certainty, subject to the provisions of Section 9 hereof and
the Plan, the aggregate number of Optioned Shares which may be purchased by the
Optionee at any time or from time to time during the term of the Option (as
prescribed by Section 3 hereof) shall be as stated below:

                                        OF OPTIONED SHARES
                                     PURCHASABLE ON OR AFTER THE
                                          INDICATED DATE

</TABLE>

     Further, for greater certainty, the Optionee may purchase all or any part
of the Optioned Shares not theretofore purchased by him or her at any time or
from time to time on or after - and on or prior to the Expiry Date (subject to
earlier termination in accordance with the provisions of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and
9 hereof and the provisions of the Plan).

5.   TERMINATION OF OPTION RIGHTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

     Subject to the immediately following paragraph, if the Optionee shall: (i)
retire, resign, be terminated or otherwise be involuntarily removed from his
employment, office, directorship or consulting relationship with the Company or
any Affiliate, as the case may be; or (ii) if such employment, office,
directorship or consulting relationship shall otherwise terminate (including as
a result of death or Disability) at any time while the Optionee holds the Option
which has not been fully exercised, the Optionee may thereafter only exercise
the Option at any time on
<PAGE>

                                      - 5 -


or prior to the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; or (ii) the close of business
on the day which is 30 days from the date of termination of the employment,
office, directorship or consulting relationship in question (one calendar year
in the event of termination due to death or Disability), however the Option may
be exercised only to the same extent to which the Optionee could have exercised
the Option immediately before the date on which such employment, office,
directorship or consulting relationship shall have terminated, in accordance
with the vesting rules prescribed by Section 4 hereof.

     However, if the Optionee otherwise remains an Eligible Person (i.e. the
Optionee or related Eligible Individual otherwise remains eligible to
participate in the Plan as a result of other directorship, office, employment or
consulting relationship), and provided that the termination of employment or
other relationship was not for "cause", then the term of the Option shall be
unaffected. For purposes of this paragraph, a determination by the Company that
the Optionee was discharged or other relationship terminated for "cause" shall
be binding upon the Optionee.

6.   EFFECT OF EMPLOYER CEASING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY

     If the Optionee is an Eligible Person solely as a result of being (or the
related Eligible Individual being) a director, officer, employee or consultant
of an Affiliate of the Company and such Affiliate ceases to be an Affiliate
while the Optionee holds the Option which has not been fully exercised, then,
provided that the Optionee does not otherwise remain an Eligible Person, the
Optionee may thereafter only exercise the Option on or prior to the earlier of:
(i) the Expiry Date; or (ii) the close of business on the day which is 30 days
from the date (the "Severance Date") on which the Affiliate ceased to be an
Affiliate of the Company, however the Option may be exercised only to the same
extent to which the Optionee could have exercised the Option immediately before
the Severance Date, in accordance with the vesting rules prescribed by Section 4
hereof.

7.   DISCRETION TO EXTEND EARLY TERMINATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

     Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 hereof, subject to the
receipt of all required regulatory approvals, the Board or the Committee may
elect to extend the term of the Option from the date on which it would otherwise
have expired pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 or Section 6 hereof to a
date no later than the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; and (ii) the close of
business on the day which is one year from the date on which the directorship,
office, employment or consulting relationship of the Optionee (or the related
Eligible Individual) is terminated, for purposes of Section 5, or one year from
the Severance Date, for purposes of Section 6.

     Such authority of the Board or the Committee shall not be considered an
entitlement of the Optionee and may be exercised or not exercised by the Board
<PAGE>

                                      - 6 -


or the Committee in their sole and absolute discretion and may be subject to
such conditions or policies as they may implement from time to time.

8.   BANKRUPTCY

     In the event that the Optionee commits an act of bankruptcy or any
proceeding is commenced against the Optionee under the applicable bankruptcy or
insolvency legislation in force at the time of such bankruptcy and such
proceeding remains undismissed or unstayed for a period of 30 days, the Optionee
may exercise the Option on or prior to the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; and
(ii) the close of business on the day which is 30 days from the date on which
the such proceeding was commenced, however the Option may be exercised only to
the same extent to which the Optionee could have exercised the Option
immediately before such proceeding was commenced, in accordance with the vesting
rules prescribed by Section 4.

9.   SALE OR REORGANIZATION

     (a)   In the event of the sale by the Company of all or substantially all
           of its property and assets (other than to an Affiliate) prior to the
           Expiry Date, the Option hereby granted may be exercised as to any or
           all of the Optioned Shares in respect of which such Option has not
           previously been exercised at any time up to and including, but not
           after, the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; or (ii) the close of
           business on the day which is 30 days following the date of the
           completion of such sale.

     (b)   If, prior to the Expiry Date, an offeror is entitled to acquire all
           of the remaining shares held by dissenting offerees, upon complying
           with the provisions of Section 188 of the BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT,
           R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (Ontario) as amended or substituted from time
           to time (the "Legislation") then, notwithstanding the terms hereof,
           the Option hereby granted may be exercised as to any or all of the
           Optioned Shares in respect of which such Option has not previously
           been exercised; provided, however, that the right to acquire Optioned
           Shares may only be exercised by the Optionee as aforesaid for a
           period expiring on the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; and (ii) the
           close of business on the day which 30 days from the date of the
           offeror's notice as contemplated under Subsection 188(2) of the
           Legislation. In this Subsection 9(b), all terms which are defined or
           have meanings attributed thereto shall take their meanings from the
           provisions hereof or from the Legislation. For greater certainty, the
           Company may accelerate the time for the exercise of the Option hereby
           granted in other circumstances in accordance with the provisions of
           the Plan.

     (c)   If: (i) the Company proposes to enter into a transaction contemplated
           in Subsection 182(1) of the Legislation; (ii) the Company proposes to


<PAGE>

                                      - 7 -


           make an issuer bid directed to all or substantially all holders
           of its shares or proposes to enter into a merger, amalgamation or
           other corporate arrangement or reorganization or to liquidate,
           dissolve or wind-up; (iii) an offer to purchase all or substantially
           all of the outstanding shares of the Company is made by a third
           party; or (iv) there occurs or is proposed a sale or transfer of
           all, or substantially all, of the undertaking, property or assets of
           the Company, the Board may, with appropriate notice and in a fair
           and equitable manner, determine (unconditionally or conditionally)
           the manner in which all unexercised Option rights granted hereunder
           shall be treated including, for example, requiring the acceleration
           of the time for the exercise of such rights by the Optionee and of
           the time for the fulfilment of any conditions or restrictions on
           such exercise, and/or declaring that the Option hereby granted shall
           be automatically vested and exercisable in full. All determinations
           of the Board under this Subsection 9(c) shall be conclusive and
           final.

10.  EXERCISE OF OPTION

     Subject to the provisions hereof and the Plan, the Option hereby granted
shall be exercisable, at any time or from time to time as aforesaid, during the
lifetime of the Optionee, by the Optionee only, or in the case of the Optionee's
death, his or her legal personal representatives, heirs or legatees, to the
extent permitted in the Plan, delivering a notice in writing addressed to the
Director, Human Resources of the Company at its principal office in the City of
Toronto, Ontario (or to such other person or address as the Company may in
writing direct), which notice shall specify therein the number of Optioned
Shares in respect of which this Option is being exercised and which shall be
accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price for the number of Optioned
Shares specified therein. The type of consideration payable shall be as provided
in Section 11 below. Upon any such exercise of this Option as aforesaid (and
providing that all applicable procedures for a valid exercise under the Plan and
this Agreement are complied with) the Company shall forthwith cause the transfer
agent and registrar of the Company to deliver to the Optionee, his or her legal
personal representatives, heirs or legatees or (subject to the Plan and
applicable law and regulatory requirements) as he, she or they may otherwise
direct in the notice of exercise of option a share certificate or certificates
in the name of the Optionee or his or her legal personal representatives, heirs
or legatees, or as he or they may have otherwise directed, representing in the
aggregate such number of Optioned Shares as shall have been specified in such
notice and paid for.

     An Optionee shall not have any rights as a shareholder of the Company with
respect to any of the Shares covered by such Option until the date of issuance
of the Shares on the records of the Company maintained by its registrar and
transfer agent upon the exercise of such Option, in full or in part, and then
only with respect to the Shares being issued. Without in any way limiting the
<PAGE>

                                      - 8 -


generality of the foregoing, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other
rights for which the record date is prior to the date such Shares are issued.

11.  CONSIDERATION

     The Optionee may satisfy the purchase price for the Optioned Shares in
respect of which an Option is exercised by:

     (a)   cash;

     (b)   certified cheque;

     (c)   bank draft;

     (d)   subject to the prior consent of the Board or the Committee,
           surrender of Shares or delivery of a properly executed form of
           attestation of ownership of Shares as the Board or Committee may
           require (including withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon
           exercise of the Option) which have a Fair Market Value on the date
           of surrender or attestation equal to the aggregate Option Price of
           the Shares as to which the Option is exercised (but only to the
           extent that such exercise of the Option would not result in a
           compensation charge for financial reporting purposes with respect
           to the Shares used to pay the exercise price, unless otherwise
           determined by the Board or Committee);

     (e)   subject to the prior consent of the Board or the Committee,
           payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance procedure
           (including, if approved by the Board and subject to regulatory
           approval, a loan facility to be provided by the Company) pursuant to
           which the Optionee: (i) shall provide written instructions to the
           Company designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of
           some or all of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of
           the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds
           to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased
           Shares; and (ii) shall provide written directions to the Company to
           deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares directly to such
           brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction; or

     (f)   any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

     Unless the Board or Committee determines otherwise, cash, certified cheques
and bank drafts provided by U.S. Employees may be denominated in U.S. dollars or
Canadian dollars. The Board or the Committee may prescribe one or more published
exchange rates for use in connection with exercises using a currency other than
the one specified in the grant agreement.

12.  NO OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE

     Nothing herein contained or contemplated shall obligate the Optionee to
purchase and/or pay for any Optioned Shares, except those Optioned Shares in
respect of which the Optionee shall have exercised his option to purchase
hereunder in the manner hereinbefore provided.

13.  TAXES

     No Optioned Shares will be delivered to the Optionee or other person
pursuant to the exercise of the Option until the Optionee or other person has
made arrangements acceptable to the Board or Committee for the satisfaction of
applicable income tax, employment tax, and social security tax withholding
obligations, including, without obligation, obligations incident to the receipt
of Optioned Shares or the disqualifying disposition of Optioned Shares received
on exercise of an Incentive Stock Option. Upon the exercise of the Option, the
Company or the Optionee's employer may offset or withhold from any amount owed
by the Company or the Optionee's employer to the Optionee or collect from the
Optionee or other person an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations or
the employer's withholding obligations.

14.  Subdivision, Consolidation or Amalgamation

     (a)   In the event of any subdivision, redivision, or other alteration of
           the share capital of the Company at any time at which the Option
           granted hereby shall be exercisable in accordance with the foregoing
           (including, however, the period prior to the Commencement Date),
           which change results in a greater number of Shares, the Company shall
           deliver, at the time of any subsequent exercise of the Option hereby
           granted, such additional number of Shares as would have resulted
           from such subdivision, redivision, or change if the particular
           exercise of the Option hereby granted had been made prior to the date
           of such subdivision, redivision, or change.

     (b)   In the event of any consolidation or other alteration of the share
           capital of the Company at any time at which the Option granted hereby
           shall be exercisable in accordance with the foregoing (including,
           however, the period prior to the Commencement Date), which change
           results in a lesser number of Shares, the number of Shares
           deliverable by the Company on any subsequent exercise of the Option
           hereby granted shall be reduced to such number of Shares as would
           have resulted from such consolidation or change if the particular
           exercise of the Option hereby granted had been made prior to the date
           of such consolidation or change.

     (c)   In the event of any consolidation, merger or amalgamation of the
           Company with or into another corporation, the Optionee shall, after
<PAGE>

                                     - 10 -


           such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, be entitled to receive
           upon any exercise of the Option hereby granted after the
           consolidation, merger or amalgamation, in lieu of Shares of the
           Company, the number and class of shares or other securities of the
           corporation continuing from such amalgamation to which he would have
           been entitled pursuant to the agreement of amalgamation (or other
           applicable documentation, however designated) if, at the effective
           date of the consolidation, merger or amalgamation, the Optionee had
           been the holder of record of a number of Shares of the Company equal
           to the number of Shares in respect of which such Option was then
           being exercised.

     (d)   In the event that the foregoing provisions of this Section 14 become
           applicable, the purchase price per Optioned Share shall be
           proportionately adjusted.

15.  NO ADDITIONAL RIGHTS IMPLIED

     The Optionee shall have no rights whatsoever as a shareholder of the
Company in respect of any Optioned Shares (including, but without limitation,
any voting rights or any right to receive dividends or other distributions
therefrom or thereon), other than in respect of Optioned Shares for which the
Optionee shall have exercised the Option and which the Optionee shall have
actually taken up and paid for.

     Nothing in the Plan or in this Agreement shall confer upon the Optionee any
right to continue or be re-elected as a director, officer or consultant or
confer any right to continue in the employ, of the Company or any Affiliate, or
affect in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate his
employment or to terminate any contract any time; nor shall anything in the Plan
or in this Agreement be deemed or construed to constitute an agreement, or an
expression of intent, on the part of the Company or any Affiliate to extend the
employment, or office, directorship or consulting relationship of any Optionee
beyond the time which he would normally be retired pursuant to the provisions of
any present or future retirement plan or policy of any such entity or beyond the
time at which he would otherwise be retired pursuant to the provisions of any
contract of employment with any such entity.

     Except as shall be specifically provided in the contract of employment or
contract for provision of services, the granting of Options is at the full
discretion of the Company and shall, therefore, not qualify as part of the terms
of employment of the Optionee. In consideration for the grant of the Option, the
Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the value or potential value of the Option
hereby granted which is forfeited as a result of the Optionee (including,
without limitation, the related Eligible Individual) ceasing to be an Eligible
Person, shall not constitute damages in respect of loss of office or employment
and no claim may be made by or


<PAGE>

                                     - 11 -


on behalf of the Optionee against the Company or any of its Affiliates in
respect thereof.

16.  TIME OF THE ESSENCE

     Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and of every part hereof.

18.  REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

     The Option, and the rights of the Optionee herein, shall be subject to the
requirement that, if at any time counsel to the Company shall determine that the
listing, registration, or qualification of the Optioned Shares upon any
securities exchange or under any law or regulation of any jurisdiction, or the
consent or approval of any securities exchange or any governmental or regulatory
body, is necessary as a condition of or in connection with the grant or exercise
of the Option or the issuance or purchase of the Optioned Shares, the Option may
not be
<PAGE>

                                     - 12 -


exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification,
consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained on conditions
acceptable to the Company. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the
Company to apply for or to obtain such listing, registration, qualification,
consent or approval.

19.  OPTIONEE REPRESENTATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

     The Optionee represents and agrees that if the Optionee exercises this
Option in whole or in part at a time when there is not in effect under the
Securities Act of 1933 a registration statement relating to the shares issuable
upon exercise hereof and there is not available for delivery a prospectus
meeting the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the said Act, (i) the Optionee
will acquire the shares upon such exercise for the purpose of investment and not
with a view to the distribution thereof, (ii) that upon each such exercise of
this Option, the Optionee will furnish to the Company an investment letter in
form and substance satisfactory to the Company, (iii) prior to selling or
offering for sale any such shares, the Optionee will furnish the Company with an
opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company to the effect that such sale may
lawfully be made and will furnish it with such certificates as to factual
matters as it may reasonably request, and (iv) that certificates representing
such shares may be marked with an appropriate legend describing such conditions
precedent to sale or transfer. Any executor, trustee, administrator or legal
personal representative entitled to exercise such Option shall furnish to the
Company letters, opinions, and certificates to the same effect as would
otherwise be required of the Optionee.

     The Optionee shall dispose of the Optioned Shares only in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the Optionee shall (i) promptly
notify the Director, Human Resources of the Company if the Optionee disposes of
any of the Optioned Shares within one (1) year after the date the Optionee
exercises all or part of the Option or within two (2) years after the date of
Option grant and (ii) provide the Company with a description of the
circumstances of such disposition. Until such time as the Optionee disposes of
such Optioned Shares in a manner consistent with the provisions of this
Agreement, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Company, the Optionee
shall hold all Optioned Shares in the Optionee's name (and not in the name of
any nominee) for the one-year period immediately after the exercise of the
Option and the two-year period immediately after the date of Option grant. At
any time during the one-year or two-year periods set forth above, the Company
may, subject to the consent of any applicable stock exchange, place a legend on
any certificate representing Optioned Shares requesting the transfer agent for
the Company's Shares to notify the Company of any such transfers. The obligation
of the Optionee to notify the Company of any such transfer shall continue
notwithstanding that a legend has been placed on the certificate pursuant to the
preceding sentence.

distribution, and may be exercisable during the lifetime of the Optionee only by
the Optionee; provided, however, that the Optionee may designate a beneficiary

hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Option, or of any right or privilege

the Company may, for all purposes, regard the Optionee as the holder of this
Option.

     Further, for greater certainty, the Optionee may purchase all or any part
of the Optioned Shares not theretofore purchased by him or her at any time or
from time to time on or after - [date of 100% vesting] and on or prior to the
Expiry Date (subject to earlier termination in accordance with the provisions of
Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 hereof and the provisions of the Plan).

5.   TERMINATION OF OPTION RIGHTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

     Subject to the immediately following paragraph, if the Optionee shall: (i)
retire, resign, be terminated or otherwise involuntarily removed from his
employment, office, directorship or consulting relationship with the Company or
any Affiliate, as the case may be; or (ii) if such employment, office,
directorship or consulting relationship shall otherwise terminate (including as
a result of death or Disability) at any time while the Optionee holds the Option
which has not been fully exercised, the Optionee may thereafter only exercise
the Option at any time on or prior to the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; or
(ii) the close of business on the day which is 30 days from the date of
termination of the employment, office, directorship or consulting relationship
in question (one calendar year in the event of termination due to death or
Disability), however the Option may be exercised only to the same extent to
which the Optionee could have exercised the Option immediately before the date
on which such employment, office, directorship or consulting relationship shall
have terminated, in accordance with the vesting rules prescribed by Section 4
hereof.


<PAGE>
                                      - 4 -


     However, if the Optionee otherwise remains an Eligible Person (i.e. the
Optionee or related Eligible Individual otherwise remains eligible to
participate in the Plan as a result of other directorship, office, employment or
consulting relationship), and provided that the termination of employment or
other relationship was not for "cause" (as construed under the laws of the
Province of Ontario, including pursuant to any relevant employment or service
contract), then the term of the Option shall be unaffected. For purposes of this
paragraph, a determination by the Company that the Optionee was discharged or
other relationship terminated for "cause" shall be binding upon the Optionee.

6.   EFFECT OF EMPLOYER CEASING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY

     If the Optionee is an Eligible Person solely as a result of being (or the
related Eligible Individual being) a director, officer, employee or consultant
of an Affiliate of the Company and such Affiliate ceases to be an Affiliate
while the Optionee holds the Option which has not been fully exercised, then,
provided that the Optionee does not otherwise remain an Eligible Person, the
Optionee may thereafter only exercise the Option on or prior to the earlier of:
(i) the Expiry Date; or (ii) the close of business on the day which is 30 days
from the date (the "Severance Date") on which the Affiliate ceased to be an
Affiliate of the Company, however the Option may be exercised only to the same
extent to which the Optionee could have exercised the Option immediately before
the Severance Date, in accordance with the vesting rules prescribed by Section 4
hereof.

7.   DISCRETION TO EXTEND EARLY TERMINATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

     Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 hereof, subject to the
receipt of all required regulatory approvals, the Board or the Committee may
elect to extend the term of the Option from the date on which it would otherwise
have expired pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 or Section 6 hereof to a
date no later than the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; and (ii) the close of
business on the day which is one year from the date on which the directorship,
office, employment or consulting relationship of the Optionee (or the related
Eligible Individual) is terminated, for purposes of Section 5, or one year from
the Severance Date, for purposes of Section 6.

     Such authority of the Board or the Committee shall not be considered an
entitlement of the Optionee and may be exercised or not exercised by the Board
or the Committee in their sole and absolute discretion and may be subject to
such conditions or policies as they may implement from time to time.

8.   BANKRUPTCY

     In the event that the Optionee commits an act of bankruptcy or any
proceeding is commenced against the Optionee under the BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY
ACT (Canada) or other applicable bankruptcy or insolvency legislation in force
at the time of such bankruptcy and such proceeding remains undismissed or
unstayed for a period of 30 days, the Optionee may thereafter


<PAGE>
                                      - 5 -


only exercise the Option at any time on or prior to the earlier of: (i) the
Expiry Date; or (ii) the close of business which is one calendar year from the
date such proceeding was commenced, however the Option may be exercised only to
the same extent to which the Optionee could have exercised the Option
immediately before the date on which such proceeding was commenced, in
accordance with the vesting rules prescribed by Section 4 hereof.

9.   SALE OR REORGANIZATION

     (a)   In the event of the sale by the Company of all or substantially all
           of its property and assets (other than to an Affiliate) prior to the
           Expiry Date, the Option hereby granted may be exercised as to any or
           all of the Optioned Shares in respect of which such Option has not
           previously been exercised at any time up to and including, but not
           after, the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; or (ii) the close of
           business on the day which is 30 days following the date of the
           completion of such sale.

     (b)   If, prior to the Expiry Date, an offeror is entitled to acquire all
           of the remaining shares held by dissenting offerees, upon complying
           with the provisions of Section 188 of the BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT,
           R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (Ontario) as amended or substituted from time to
           time (the "Legislation") then, notwithstanding the terms hereof, the
           Option hereby granted may be exercised as to any or all of the
           Optioned Shares in respect of which such Option has not previously
           been exercised; provided, however, that the right to acquire Optioned
           Shares may only be exercised by the Optionee as aforesaid for a
           period expiring on the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date; and (ii) the
           close of business on the day which 30 days from the date of the
           offeror's notice as contemplated under Subsection 188(2) of the
           Legislation. In this Subsection 9(b), all terms which are defined or
           have meanings attributed thereto shall take their meanings from the
           provisions hereof or from the Legislation. For greater certainty, the
           Company may accelerate the time for the exercise of the Option hereby
           granted in other circumstances in accordance with the provisions of
           the Plan.

     (c)   If: (i) the Company proposes to enter into a transaction contemplated
           in Subsection 182(1) of the Legislation; (ii) the Company proposes to
           make an issuer bid directed to all or substantially all holders of
           its shares or proposes to enter into a merger, amalgamation or other
           corporate arrangement or reorganization or to liquidate, dissolve or
           wind-up; (iii) an offer to purchase all or substantially all of the
           outstanding shares of the Company is made by a third party; or (iv)
           there occurs or is proposed a sale or transfer of all, or
           substantially all, of the undertaking, property or assets of the
           Company, the Board may, with appropriate notice and in a fair and
           equitable manner, determine (unconditionally or conditionally) the
           manner in which all unexercised Option rights granted hereunder shall
           be treated including, for example, requiring the acceleration of the
           time for the exercise of such rights by the Optionee and of the time
           for the fulfilment of any
<PAGE>

                                      - 6 -


           conditions or restrictions on such exercise, and/or declaring that
           the Option hereby granted shall be automatically vested and
           exercisable in full. All determinations of the Board under this
           Subsection 9(c) shall be conclusive and final.

10.  EXERCISE OF OPTION

     Subject to the provisions hereof and the Plan, the Option hereby granted
shall be exercisable, at any time or from time to time as aforesaid, by the
Optionee, or in the case of the Optionee's death, his or her legal personal
representatives, heirs or legatees delivering a notice in writing addressed to
the Director, Human Resources of the Company at its principal office in the City
of Toronto, Ontario (or to such other person or address as the Company may in
writing direct), which notice shall specify therein the number of Optioned
Shares in respect of which this Option is being exercised and, subject to
Section 11 hereof, which shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase
price for the number of Optioned Shares specified therein. Upon any such
exercise of this Option as aforesaid (and provided that all applicable terms and
provisions of the Plan and this Agreement have been satisfied), the Company
shall cause the transfer agent and registrar of the Company to deliver to the
Optionee, his or her legal personal representatives, heirs or legatees or
(subject to the Plan and applicable law and regulatory requirements) as he, she
or they may otherwise direct in the notice of exercise of option, a share
certificate or certificates in the name of the Optionee or his or her legal
personal representatives, heirs or legatees, or as he or they may have otherwise
directed, representing in the aggregate such number of Optioned Shares as shall
have been specified in such notice and paid for.

     An Optionee shall not have any rights as a shareholder of the Company with
respect to any of the Shares covered by such Option until the date of issuance
of the Shares on the records of the Company maintained by its Registrar and
Transfer Agent upon the exercise of such Option, in full or in part, and then
only with respect to the Shares being issued. Without in any way limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or other
rights for which the record date is prior to the date such Shares are issued.

11.  CONSIDERATION

     The Optionee may satisfy the purchase price for the Optioned Shares in
respect of which an Option is exercised by:

     (a)   cash;

     (b)   certified cheque;

     (c)   bank draft;

     (d)   subject to the prior consent of the Board or the Committee, surrender
           of Shares or delivery of a properly executed form of attestation of
           ownership of Shares as the Board or Committee may require (including
           withholding of Shares otherwise
<PAGE>

                                      - 7 -


           deliverable upon exercise of the Option) which have a Market Price
           on the date of surrender or attestation equal to the aggregate Option
           Price of the Shares as to which the Option is exercised (but only to
           the extent that such exercise of the Option would not result in a
           compensation charge for financial reporting purposes with respect to
           the Shares used to pay the exercise price, unless otherwise
           determined by the Board or Committee);

     (e)   subject to the prior consent of the Board or the Committee, payment
           through a broker-dealer sale and remittance procedure (including, if
           approved by the Board and subject to regulatory approval, a loan
           facility to be provided by the Company) pursuant to which the
           Optionee: (i) shall provide written instructions to the Company
           designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of some or all
           of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale
           proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover
           the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased Shares; and
           (ii) shall provide written directions to the Company to deliver the
           certificates for the purchased Shares directly to such brokerage firm
           in order to complete the sale transaction; or

     (f)   any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

     Unless the Board or Committee determines otherwise, cash, certified cheques
and bank drafts provided by Optionees who are resident Canadians as
consideration for Shares shall be denominated in Canadian dollars; cash,
certified cheques and bank drafts provided by all other Optionees may be
denominated in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars. The Board or the Committee may
prescribe one or more published exchange rates for use in connection with
exercises using a currency other than the one specified in the grant agreement.

12.  NO OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE

     Nothing herein contained or contemplated shall obligate the Optionee to
purchase and/or pay for any Optioned Shares, except those Optioned Shares in
respect of which the Optionee shall have exercised his option to purchase
hereunder in the manner hereinbefore provided.

13.  SUBDIVISION, CONSOLIDATION OR AMALGAMATION

     (a)   In the event of any subdivision, redivision, or other alteration of
           the share capital of the Company at any time at which the Option
           granted hereby shall be exercisable in accordance with the foregoing
           (including, however, the period prior to the Commencement Date),
           which change results in a greater number of Shares, the Company shall
           deliver, at the time of any subsequent exercise of the Option hereby
           granted, such additional number of Shares as would have resulted from
           such subdivision, redivision, or change if the particular exercise
           of the Option
<PAGE>

                                      - 8 -


           hereby granted had been made prior to the date of such subdivision,
           redivision, or change.

     (b)   In the event of any consolidation or other alteration of the share
           capital of the Company at any time at which the Option granted hereby
           shall be exercisable in accordance with the foregoing (including,
           however, the period prior to the Commencement Date), which change
           results in a lesser number of Shares, the number of Shares
           deliverable by the Company on any subsequent exercise of the Option
           hereby granted shall be reduced to such number of Shares as would
           have resulted from such consolidation or change if the particular
           exercise of the Option hereby granted had been made prior to the date
           of such consolidation or change.

     (c)   In the event of any consolidation, merger or amalgamation of the
           Company with or into another corporation, the Optionee shall, after
           such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, be entitled to receive
           upon any exercise of the Option hereby granted after the
           consolidation, merger or amalgamation, in lieu of Shares of the
           Company, the number and class of shares or other securities of the
           corporation continuing from such amalgamation to which he would have
           been entitled pursuant to the agreement of amalgamation (or other
           applicable documentation, however designated) if, at the effective
           date of the consolidation, merger or amalgamation, the Optionee had
           been the holder of record of a number of Shares of the Company equal
           to the number of Shares in respect of which such Option was then
           being exercised.

     (d)   In the event that the foregoing provisions of this Section 13 become
           applicable, the purchase price per Optioned Share shall be
           proportionately adjusted.

14.  NO ADDITIONAL RIGHTS IMPLIED

     The Optionee shall have no rights whatsoever as a shareholder of the
Company in respect of any Optioned Shares (including, but without limitation,
any voting rights or any right to receive dividends or other distributions
therefrom or thereon), other than in respect of Optioned Shares for which the
Optionee shall have exercised the Option and which the Optionee shall have
actually taken up and paid for.

     Nothing in the Plan or in this Agreement shall confer upon the Optionee any
right to continue or be re-elected as a director, officer or consultant or
confer any right to continue in the employ, of the Company or any Affiliate, or
affect in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate his
employment or to terminate any contract at any time; nor shall anything in the
Plan or in this Agreement be deemed or construed to constitute an agreement, or
an expression of intent, on the part of the Company or any Affiliate to extend
the employment, or office, directorship or consulting relationship of any
Optionee beyond the time which he would normally be retired pursuant to the
provisions of any present or future retirement plan or policy of
<PAGE>

                                      - 9 -


any such entity or beyond the time at which he would otherwise be retired
pursuant to the provisions of any contract of employment with any such entity.

     Except as shall be specifically provided in the contract of employment or
contract for provision of services, the granting of Options is at the full
discretion of the Company and shall, therefore, not qualify as part of the terms
of employment of the Optionee. In consideration for the grant of the Option, the
Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the value or potential value of the Option
hereby granted which is forfeited as a result of the Optionee (including,
without limitation, the related Eligible Individual) ceasing to be an Eligible
Person, shall not constitute damages in respect of loss of office or employment
and no claim may be made by or on behalf of the Optionee against the Company or
any of its Affiliates in respect thereof.

15.  TIME OF THE ESSENCE

     Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and of every part hereof.

Program, a copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule A (the "Program");

                  AND WHEREAS the Company has determined  that it is in the best
interests of the Company to grant to the  Optionee an option to purchase  common
shares of the Company as a performance  incentive  upon the terms and conditions
contained herein;

                  NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT  WITNESSETH that in consideration
of the mutual covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.       DEFINED TERMS

                  All  capitalized  terms used herein and not otherwise  defined
have the same meaning as in the 724  Solutions  Inc.  2000 Stock Option Plan and
the Program  authorized under Section 3.6 of such Plan, all as amended from time
to time (collectively,  the "Plan").  All references herein to the Plan shall be
deemed to include a reference  to the terms of the Plan as amended  from time to
time.

2.       COMMON SHARE PURCHASE OPTION

                  Subject to the terms  hereof and the  provisions  of the Plan,
the Company hereby grants to the Optionee an  irrevocable  option (the "Option")
to  purchase  up to o Shares  (hereinafter  collectively  called  the  "Optioned
Shares") at the purchase price of U.S. $o per Share.

                                     - 2 -


                  THIS OPTION IS INTENDED TO HAVE THE TAX STATUS OF AN INCENTIVE
STOCK OPTION. This Option is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option within the
meaning of Section 422(b) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended  (the Code"),  but the Company  does not  represent or warrant that this
Option  qualifies as such.  The Optionee  should consult with the Optionee's own
tax  advisor  regarding  the tax  effect  of this  Option  and the  requirements
necessary to obtain  favourable  income tax  treatment  under Section 422 of the
Code,  including,  but not limited to,  holding  period  requirements.  (NOTE TO
OPTIONEE:  If the Option is exercised  more than three (3) months after the date
on which you cease to be a U.S.  Employee (other than by reason of your death or
permanent and total  disability as defined  Section  22(e)(3) of the Code),  the
Option will be treated as a  Non-Qualified  Stock Option and not as an Incentive
Stock Option to the extent required by Section 422 of the Code.)

                  INCENTIVE  STOCK OPTION FAIR MARKET VALUE  LIMITATION.  To the
extent that this Option  (together with all Incentive  Stock Options  granted to
the Optionee  under all stock option plans of the Company or any  Subsidiary  or
Parent,  including the Plan) becomes  exercisable  for the first time during any
calendar year for Shares having a Fair Market Value (as defined  below)  greater
than One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (U.S. $100,000),  the portion of
such Option which exceeds such amount will be treated as a  Non-Qualified  Stock
Option.  For purposes of this Section 2, options  designated as Incentive  Stock
Options are taken into account in the order in which they were granted,  and the
Fair Market Value of Shares is determined as of the date the option with respect
to such  Shares is  granted.  If the Code is amended to provide  for a different
limitation  from that set forth in this  Section  2, such  different  limitation
shall  be  deemed  incorporated  herein  effective  as of the date  required  or
permitted  by such  amendment  to the  Code.  If this  Option is  treated  as an
Incentive  Stock Option in part and as a  Non-Qualified  Stock Option in part by
reason of the limitation set forth in this Section 2, the Optionee may designate
which portion of such Option the Optionee is exercising.  In the absence of such
designation,  the Optionee shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock
Option portion of the Option first. Separate certificates representing each such
portion  shall be issued upon the  exercise of the Option.  No  Incentive  Stock
Option  shall be granted to an  Optionee  if, at the time the Option is granted,
such  Optionee owns shares  possessing  more than ten percent (10%) of the total
combined  voting  power of all classes of shares of the Company or of its Parent
or a  Subsidiary,  unless  (i) at the time such  Option is  granted  the  Option
exercise  price is at least one hundred  ten  percent  (110%) of the Fair Market
Value of the Shares  subject to the Option and (ii) such  Option by its terms is
not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date of grant. (NOTE
TO  OPTIONEE:  If the  aggregate  exercise  price of the  Option  (that is,  the
exercise price  multiplied by the number of Optioned  Shares) plus the aggregate
exercise price of any other  Incentive  Stock Options you hold (whether  granted
pursuant  to the Plan or any  other  stock  option  plan of the  Company  or any
Subsidiary)  is greater than U.S.  $100,000,  you should  contact the  Director,
Human Resources of the Company to ascertain  whether the entire Option qualifies
as an Incentive Stock Option.)

                                     - 3 -


                  FAIR MARKET  VALUE.  In this  Agreement,  "Fair Market  Value"
shall mean as of any  specified  date,  the  closing  price of the Shares of the
Company on the TSE or The NASDAQ  Stock  Market,  Inc.  (or if the Shares of the
Company  are not  listed  on such  exchanges,  such  other  national  securities
exchange on which the Shares are then listed) on that date,  or if no prices are
reported on that date,  on the last  preceding  date on which such prices of the
Shares are still  reported.  If the Shares of the Company are not then listed on
any national securities exchange but are traded over the counter at the time the
determination  of its Fair Market  Value is required to be made  hereunder,  its
Fair  Market  Value  shall be  deemed  to be equal to the  average  between  the
reported  high and low sales  prices of the  Shares of the  Company  on the most
recent  date on which the  Shares  were  publicly  traded.  If the Shares of the
Company  are not  publicly  traded at the time a  determination  of its value is
required to be made hereunder,  the determination of its Fair Market Value shall
be made by the Board or Committee in such manner as it deems  appropriate  (such
determination will be made in good-faith as required by Section 422(c)(1) of the
Code and may be based on the  advice  of an  independent  investment  banker  or
appraiser recognized to be an expert in making such evaluations).

3.       OPTION TERM

                  Subject to the vesting  rules  contained  in Section 4 hereof,
the Option  hereby  granted may be exercised  with respect to all or any part of
the Optioned Shares at any time or from time to time prior to the earlier of:

         (i)      the close of business on o (the "Expiry Date"); or

         (ii)     such earlier  termination  time as may be prescribed by the
                  provisions of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 hereof or pursuant to
                  the Plan.

                  At the time of  termination,  as prescribed by the immediately
preceding  sentence,  the  Option  hereby  granted  shall  forthwith  expire and
terminate  and be of no force or effect  whatsoever  as to such of the  Optioned
Shares  in  respect  of which  the  Option  hereby  granted  has not  then  been
exercised.

4.       VESTING

                  During  the term of the  Option  (as  prescribed  by Section 3
hereof), the Optionee may purchase up to but not exceeding:

         (i)      o Shares at any time after the date of this Agreement;

         (ii)     an additional o Shares at any time after the first
                  anniversary of the date of this Agreement;

         (iii)    an  additional  o Shares at any time after the second
                  anniversary  of the date of this Agreement; and


<PAGE>


                                     - 4 -


         (iv)     an additional o Shares at any time after the third
                  anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

                  If the Optionee shall,  during any such year, not exercise his
or her right to purchase  all of the  Optioned  Shares  purchasable  during such
year,  then the Optionee shall have the right,  at any time or from time to time
thereafter  but prior to the expiry of the Option  (as  prescribed  by Section 3
hereof),  to  purchase  the  Optioned  Shares  which  were  purchasable  but not
purchased by him or her during the particular year.

                  For greater certainty,  subject to the provisions of Section 9
hereof  and the Plan,  the  aggregate  number of  Optioned  Shares  which may be
purchased  by the  Optionee  at any time or from time to time during the term of
the Option (as prescribed by Section 3 hereof) shall be as stated below:


     =====================================================================

               VESTING DATE                 CUMULATIVE AGGREGATE
                                             NUMBER OF OPTIONED
                                            SHARES PURCHASABLE ON
                                            OR AFTER THE INDICATED
                                                    DATE

     =====================================================================

          Date of this Agreement                      o

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                    o                                 o
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                    o                                 o
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                    o                                 o
     =====================================================================


                  Further, for greater certainty,  the Optionee may purchase all
or any part of the Optioned  Shares not  theretofore  purchased by him or her at
any time or from time to time on or after o and on or prior to the  Expiry  Date
(subject to earlier termination in accordance with the provisions of Sections 5,
6, 7, 8 and 9 hereof and the provisions of the Plan).

5.       TERMINATION OF OPTION RIGHTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

                  Subject  to  the  immediately  following  paragraph,   if  the
Optionee shall: (i) retire,  resign, be terminated or otherwise be involuntarily
removed from his employment,  office,  directorship  or consulting  relationship
with  the  Company  or any  Affiliate,  as the  case  may  be;  or  (ii) if such
employment,  office,  directorship  or consulting  relationship  shall otherwise
terminate  (including as a result of death or  Disability) at any time while the
Optionee holds the Option which has not been fully  exercised,  the Optionee may
thereafter  only  exercise the Option at any time on or prior to the earlier of:
(i) the Expiry  Date;  or (ii) the close of business on the day


<PAGE>


                                     - 5 -


which  is 30 days  from  the  date of  termination  of the  employment,  office,
directorship  or consulting  relationship  in question (one calendar year in the
event of  termination  due to death or  Disability),  however  the Option may be
exercised only to the same extent to which the Optionee could have exercised the
Option   immediately   before  the  date  on  which  such  employment,   office,
directorship or consulting  relationship  shall have  terminated,  in accordance
with the vesting rules prescribed by Section 4 hereof.

                  However,  if the Optionee otherwise remains an Eligible Person
(i.e. the Optionee or related Eligible Individual  otherwise remains eligible to
participate in the Plan as a result of other directorship, office, employment or
consulting  relationship),  and provided that the  termination  of employment or
other  relationship  was not for  "cause",  then the term of the Option shall be
unaffected.  For purposes of this paragraph, a determination by the Company that
the Optionee was discharged or other  relationship  terminated for "cause" shall
be binding upon the Optionee.

6.       EFFECT OF EMPLOYER CEASING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY

                  If the  Optionee is an Eligible  Person  solely as a result of
being (or the related Eligible Individual being) a director,  officer,  employee
or consultant of an Affiliate of the Company and such Affiliate  ceases to be an
Affiliate  while  the  Optionee  holds  the  Option  which  has not  been  fully
exercised,  then,  provided  that the  Optionee  does not  otherwise  remain  an
Eligible  Person,  the Optionee may  thereafter  only  exercise the Option on or
prior to the earlier of: (i) the Expiry  Date;  or (ii) the close of business on
the day  which is 30 days  from the date  (the  "Severance  Date")  on which the
Affiliate  ceased to be an Affiliate  of the Company,  however the Option may be
exercised only to the same extent to which the Optionee could have exercised the
Option  immediately  before the Severance  Date, in accordance  with the vesting
rules prescribed by Section 4 hereof.

7.       DISCRETION TO EXTEND EARLY TERMINATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

                  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Sections 5 and 6 hereof,
subject to the receipt of all required  regulatory  approvals,  the Board or the
Committee  may elect to extend the term of the Option  from the date on which it
would otherwise have expired  pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 or Section
6 hereof to a date no later than the earlier of: (i) the Expiry  Date;  and (ii)
the  close of  business  on the day which is one year from the date on which the
directorship,  office, employment or consulting relationship of the Optionee (or
the related  Eligible  Individual) is terminated,  for purposes of Section 5, or
one year from the Severance Date, for purposes of Section 6.

                  Such  authority  of the  Board or the  Committee  shall not be
considered an  entitlement of the Optionee and may be exercised or not exercised
by the Board


<PAGE>


                                     - 6 -


or the  Committee  in their sole and absolute  discretion  and may be subject to
such conditions or policies as they may implement from time to time.

8.       BANKRUPTCY

                  In the event that the Optionee commits an act of bankruptcy or
any proceeding is commenced against the Optionee under the applicable bankruptcy
or  insolvency  legislation  in force at the  time of such  bankruptcy  and such
proceeding remains undismissed or unstayed for a period of 30 days, the Optionee
may exercise the Option on or prior to the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date;  and
(ii) the  close of  business  on the day which is 30 days from the date on which
the such  proceeding was commenced,  however the Option may be exercised only to
the  same  extent  to  which  the  Optionee  could  have  exercised  the  Option
immediately before such proceeding was commenced, in accordance with the vesting
rules prescribed by Section 4.

9.       SALE OR REORGANIZATION

    (a)  If, prior to the Expiry Date,  an offeror is entitled to acquire all of
         the remaining shares held by dissenting  offerees,  upon complying with
         the provisions of Section 188 of the BUSINESS  CORPORATIONS ACT, R.S.O.
         1990,  c. B.16  (Ontario) as amended or  substituted  from time to time
         (the  "Legislation")  then the  Board  may,  notwithstanding  the terms
         hereof,  resolve that the Option hereby  granted may be exercised as to
         any or all of the  Optioned  Shares in respect of which such Option has
         not previously been  exercised;  provided,  however,  that the right to
         acquire  Optioned  Shares  may only be  exercised  by the  Optionee  as
         aforesaid for a period expiring on the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date;
         and (ii) the close of  business  on the day which 30 days from the date
         of the offeror's notice as contemplated  under Subsection 188(2) of the
         Legislation.  In this  Subsection  9(a), all terms which are defined or
         have meanings  attributed  thereto  shall take their  meanings from the
         provisions hereof or from the Legislation.  For greater certainty,  the
         Company may  accelerate  the time for the exercise of the Option hereby
         granted in other circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the
         Plan.

    (b)  If: (i) the Company  proposes to enter into a transaction  contemplated
         in Subsection  182(1) of the Legislation;  (ii) the Company proposes to
         make an issuer bid directed to all or substantially  all holders of its
         shares  or  proposes  to enter  into a  merger,  amalgamation  or other
         corporate  arrangement or reorganization  or to liquidate,  dissolve or
         wind-up;  (iii) an offer to purchase  all or  substantially  all of the
         outstanding  shares of the  Company is made by a third  party;  or (iv)
         there occurs or is proposed a sale or transfer of all, or substantially
         all, of the undertaking,  property or assets of the Company,  the Board
         may,  with  appropriate  notice  and in a fair  and  equitable  manner,
         determine


<PAGE>


                                     - 7 -


         (unconditionally  or conditionally) the manner in which all
         unexercised  Option rights  granted  hereunder shall be treated
         including, for example,  requiring the acceleration of the time for
         the  exercise  of such rights by the  Optionee  and of the time for
         the  fulfilment  of any  conditions  or  restrictions  on such
         exercise,  and/or  declaring  that the Option  hereby  granted shall
         be automatically vested and exercisable in full. All determinations
         of the Board under this Subsection 9(b) shall be conclusive and
         final.

10.      EXERCISE OF OPTION

                  Subject  to the  provisions  hereof  and the Plan,  the Option
hereby  granted  shall  be  exercisable,  at any  time or  from  time to time as
aforesaid,  during the lifetime of the Optionee, by the Optionee only, or in the
case of the Optionee's death, his or her legal personal  representatives,  heirs
or legatees, to the extent permitted in the Plan, delivering a notice in writing
addressed  to the  Director,  Human  Resources  of the Company at its  principal
office in the City of Toronto,  Ontario  (or to such other  person or address as
the Company may in writing  direct),  which  notice  shall  specify  therein the
number of Optioned Shares in respect of which this Option is being exercised and
which  shall be  accompanied  by payment in full of the  purchase  price for the
number of Optioned Shares specified therein.  The type of consideration  payable
shall be as provided in Section 11 below.  Upon any such exercise of this Option
as aforesaid (and providing that all applicable  procedures for a valid exercise
under the Plan and this Agreement are complied with) the Company shall forthwith
cause  the  transfer  agent and  registrar  of the  Company  to  deliver  to the
Optionee,  his or her  legal  personal  representatives,  heirs or  legatees  or
(subject to the Plan and applicable law and regulatory  requirements) as he, she
or they may  otherwise  direct  in the  notice  of  exercise  of  option a share
certificate  or  certificates  in the name of the  Optionee  or his or her legal
personal representatives, heirs or legatees, or as he or they may have otherwise
directed,  representing in the aggregate such number of Optioned Shares as shall
have been specified in such notice and paid for.

                  An Optionee  shall not have any rights as a shareholder of the
Company with respect to any of the Shares  covered by such Option until the date
of  issuance  of the Shares on the  records  of the  Company  maintained  by its
registrar  and transfer  agent upon the  exercise of such Option,  in full or in
part, and then only with respect to the Shares being issued.  Without in any way
limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing,  no  adjustment  shall be made for
dividends  or other  rights for which the record  date is prior to the date such
Shares are issued.

11.      CONSIDERATION

                  The Optionee  may satisfy the purchase  price for the Optioned
Shares in respect of which an Option is exercised by:

    (a)           cash;


<PAGE>


                                     - 8 -


    (b)           certified cheque;

    (c)           bank draft;

    (d)           subject to the prior  consent  of the Board or the  Committee,
                  surrender of Shares or delivery of a properly executed form of
                  attestation  of  ownership of Shares as the Board or Committee
                  may  require   (including   withholding  of  Shares  otherwise
                  deliverable  upon  exercise of the  Option)  which have a Fair
                  Market Value on the date of surrender or attestation  equal to
                  the  aggregate  Option  Price of the  Shares  as to which  the
                  Option is exercised (but only to the extent that such exercise
                  of the Option  would not result in a  compensation  charge for
                  financial  reporting  purposes with respect to the Shares used
                  to pay the exercise price, unless otherwise  determined by the
                  Board or Committee);

    (e)           subject to the prior  consent  of the Board or the  Committee,
                  payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance  procedure
                  (including, if approved by the Board and subject to regulatory
                  approval,  a loan  facility  to be  provided  by the  Company)
                  pursuant  to which the  Optionee:  (i) shall  provide  written
                  instructions  to the  Company  designated  brokerage  firm  to
                  effect  the  immediate  sale of  some or all of the  purchased
                  Shares  and  remit to the  Company,  out of the sale  proceeds
                  available on the settlement  date,  sufficient  funds to cover
                  the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased Shares;
                  and (ii) shall  provide  written  directions to the Company to
                  deliver the  certificates for the purchased Shares directly to
                  such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction;
                  or

    (f)           any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

                  Unless  the Board or  Committee  determines  otherwise,  cash,
certified cheques and bank drafts provided by U.S.  Employees may be denominated
in U.S.  dollars or Canadian  dollars.  The Board or the Committee may prescribe
one or more published  exchange rates for use in connection with exercises using
a currency other than the one specified in the grant agreement.

12.      NO OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE

                  Nothing herein  contained or  contemplated  shall obligate the
Optionee to purchase and/or pay for any Optioned  Shares,  except those Optioned
Shares in  respect of which the  Optionee  shall  have  exercised  his option to
purchase hereunder in the manner hereinbefore provided.

13.      TAXES

                  No Optioned  Shares will be delivered to the Optionee or other
person pursuant to the exercise of the Option until the Optionee or other person
has made arrangements  acceptable to the Board or Committee for the satisfaction
of


<PAGE>


                                     - 9 -


applicable  income tax,  employment  tax, and social  security  tax  withholding
obligations,  including, without obligation, obligations incident to the receipt
of Optioned Shares or the disqualifying  disposition of Optioned Shares received
on exercise of an Incentive Stock Option.  Upon the exercise of the Option,  the
Company or the  Optionee's  employer may offset or withhold from any amount owed
by the Company or the  Optionee's  employer to the  Optionee or collect from the
Optionee or other person an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations or
the  employer's  withholding  obligations.

14.      SUBDIVISION,  CONSOLIDATION  OR AMALGAMATION

    (a)  In the event of any subdivision, redivision, or other alteration of the
         share  capital of the  Company at any time at which the Option  granted
         hereby shall be  exercisable  in accordance  with the  foregoing  which
         change  results  in a  greater  number of  Shares,  the  Company  shall
         deliver,  at the time of any  subsequent  exercise of the Option hereby
         granted,  such additional  number of Shares as would have resulted from
         such subdivision,  redivision,  or change if the particular exercise of
         the  Option  hereby  granted  had been  made  prior to the date of such
         subdivision, redivision, or change.

    (b)  In the  event of any  consolidation  or other  alteration  of the share
         capital of the Company at any time at which the Option  granted  hereby
         shall be  exercisable  in accordance  with the  foregoing  which change
         results in a lesser number of Shares,  the number of Shares deliverable
         by the Company on any subsequent  exercise of the Option hereby granted
         shall be reduced to such number of Shares as would have  resulted  from
         such  consolidation or change if the particular  exercise of the Option
         hereby granted had been made prior to the date of such consolidation or
         change.

    (c)  In the  event  of any  consolidation,  merger  or  amalgamation  of the
         Company with or into another  corporation,  the Optionee  shall,  after
         such consolidation, merger or amalgamation, be entitled to receive upon
         any  exercise of the Option  hereby  granted  after the  consolidation,
         merger or  amalgamation,  in lieu of Shares of the Company,  the number
         and class of shares or other  securities of the corporation  continuing
         from such amalgamation to which he would have been entitled pursuant to
         the  agreement  of  amalgamation  (or other  applicable  documentation,
         however  designated)  if, at the effective  date of the  consolidation,
         merger or amalgamation, the Optionee had been the holder of record of a
         number  of  Shares  of the  Company  equal to the  number  of Shares in
         respect of which such Option was then being exercised.

    (d)  In the event that the  foregoing  provisions  of this Section 14 become
         applicable,   the   purchase   price  per   Optioned   Share  shall  be
         proportionately adjusted.

15.      NO ADDITIONAL RIGHTS IMPLIED

                  The Optionee shall have no rights  whatsoever as a shareholder
of the  Company  in respect  of any  Optioned  Shares  (including,  but  without
limitation,  any  voting  rights  or any  right to  receive  dividends  or other
distributions  therefrom or thereon),  other than in respect of Optioned  Shares
for which the Optionee  shall have  exercised  the Option and which the Optionee
shall have actually taken up and paid for.

                  Nothing in the Plan or in this Agreement shall confer upon the
Optionee  any right to  continue  or be  re-elected  as a  director,  officer or
consultant or confer any right to continue in the employ,  of the Company or any
Affiliate,  or affect in any way the right of the  Company or any  Affiliate  to
terminate  his  employment  or to terminate  any  contract  any time;  nor shall
anything in the Plan or in this  Agreement be deemed or construed to  constitute
an  agreement,  or an  expression  of intent,  on the part of the Company or any
Affiliate  to extend the  employment,  or  office,  directorship  or  consulting
relationship  of any Optionee beyond the time which he would normally be retired
pursuant to the provisions of any present or future retirement plan or policy of
any such  entity  or  beyond  the time at which he would  otherwise  be  retired
pursuant to the provisions of any contract of employment with any such entity.

                  Except as shall be  specifically  provided in the  contract of
employment or contract for provision of services,  the granting of Options is at
the full discretion of the Company and shall, therefore,  not qualify as part of
the terms of employment of the Optionee.  In consideration  for the grant of the
Option,  the Optionee  acknowledges and agrees that the value or potential value
of the Option  hereby  granted  which is  forfeited  as a result of the Optionee
(including,  without limitation,  the related Eligible Individual) ceasing to be
an Eligible Person, shall not constitute damages in respect of loss of office or
employment and no claim may be made by or on behalf of the Optionee  against the
Company or any of its Affiliates in respect thereof.

16.      TIME OF THE ESSENCE

                  Time shall be of the  essence of this  Agreement  and of every
part hereof.

18.      REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

                  The Option,  and the rights of the Optionee  herein,  shall be

determine  that the  listing,  registration,  or  qualification  of the Optioned
Shares  upon any  securities  exchange  or under  any law or  regulation  of any
jurisdiction,  or the  consent or  approval  of any  securities  exchange or any
governmental or regulatory body, is necessary as a condition of or in connection
with the grant or  exercise  of the Option or the  issuance  or  purchase of the
Optioned Shares, the Option may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such
listing,  registration,  qualification,  consent  or  approval  shall  have been
effected or obtained on  conditions  acceptable to the Company.  Nothing  herein
shall be deemed to require the  Company to apply for or to obtain such  listing,
registration, qualification, consent or approval.

19.      OPTIONEE REPRESENTATIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

                  The  Optionee  represents  and  agrees  that  if the  Optionee
exercises  this Option in whole or in part at a time when there is not in effect
under the SECURITIES ACT of 1933 a registration statement relating to the shares
issuable  upon  exercise  hereof  and  there is not  available  for  delivery  a
prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the said Act, (i) the
Optionee  will  acquire  the  shares  upon  such


<PAGE>


                                     - 12 -


exercise for the purpose of investment  and not with a view to the  distribution
thereof,  (ii) that upon each such  exercise of this Option,  the Optionee  will
furnish to the Company an investment  letter in form and substance  satisfactory
to the Company, (iii) prior to selling or offering for sale any such shares, the
Optionee will furnish the Company with an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the
Company to the effect that such sale may  lawfully  be made and will  furnish it
with such certificates as to factual matters as it may reasonably  request,  and
(iv)  that  certificates   representing  such  shares  may  be  marked  with  an
appropriate legend describing such conditions precedent to sale or transfer. Any
executor,  trustee,  administrator or legal personal  representative entitled to
exercise  such  Option  shall  furnish to the  Company  letters,  opinions,  and
certificates to the same effect as would otherwise be required of the Optionee.

                  The  Optionee  shall  dispose of the  Optioned  Shares only in
accordance  with the  provisions of this  Agreement.  In addition,  the Optionee
shall (i) promptly  notify the Director,  Human  Resources of the Company if the
Optionee  disposes of any of the Optioned  Shares  within one (1) year after the
date the  Optionee  exercises  all or part of the Option or within two (2) years
after the date of Option grant and (ii)  provide the Company with a  description
of the  circumstances  of such  disposition.  Until  such  time as the  Optionee
disposes of such Optioned  Shares in a manner  consistent with the provisions of
this  Agreement,  unless  otherwise  expressly  authorized  by the Company,  the
Optionee shall hold all Optioned  Shares in the Optionee's  name (and not in the
name of any nominee) for the one-year period  immediately  after the exercise of
the Option and the two-year period  immediately  after the date of Option grant.
At any time during the one-year or two-year periods set forth above, the Company
may, subject to the consent of any applicable stock exchange,  place a legend on
any certificate  representing  Optioned Shares requesting the transfer agent for
the Company's Shares to notify the Company of any such transfers. The obligation
of the  Optionee  to notify the  Company  of any such  transfer  shall  continue
notwithstanding that a legend has been placed on the certificate pursuant to the
preceding sentence.

to  which  the  Company  is  a  party,   this  Agreement   contains  the  entire

contained.  There are no representations,  warranties,  promises,  covenants, or

21.      MODIFICATIONS/WAIVERS

                  No  waiver  or  modification  of  any  of the  terms  of  this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same is reduced to writing and signed by the
parties  hereto.  The waiver by either of the  parties of a breach or default by
the other of them shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any preceding or
subsequent  breach  or  default  of the  same  or any  other  provision  of this
Agreement.

         OPTIONEE

                  This  Agreement  shall  enure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Company,  its successors and assigns, and the Optionee and, in the case
of the  Optionee's  death,  his legal personal  representatives.  Subject to the
terms hereof and the terms of the Plan,  this Option  shall be  non-transferable
and  non-assignable by the Optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent
or distribution, and may be exercisable during the lifetime of the Optionee only
by  the  Optionee;   provided,  however,  that  the  Optionee  may  designate  a
beneficiary of the Optionee's  Option in the event of the Optionee's  death on a
beneficiary designation form provided by the Board or Committee. After the death
of the Optionee,  this Option may be exercised  prior to its  termination by the
Optionee's legal  representatives,  heir or legatee,  to the extent permitted in
the Plan or this  Agreement.  Upon any  attempt  to  transfer,  assign,  pledge,
hypothecate  or otherwise  dispose of this Option,  or of any right or privilege
conferred hereby,  contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon any attempted sale
under any execution,  attachment or similar process of the rights and privileges
conferred  hereby,  this Option and the rights and privileges  conferred  hereby
shall,  at the  Company's  election,  immediately  become  null and void.  Until
written  notice of any permitted  passage of rights under this Option shall have
been given to, and received by, the  Director,  Human  Resources of the Company,
the Company  may,  for all  purposes,  regard the Optionee as the holder of this
Option.

2.       COMMON SHARE PURCHASE OPTION

                  Subject to the terms  hereof and the  provisions  of the Plan,

3.       OPTION TERM

         (ii)     such  earlier  termination  time as may be  prescribed  by the
                  provisions  of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 hereof or pursuant to

exercised.

4.       VESTING

                  During  the term of the  Option  (as  prescribed  by Section 3

                                     - 3 -


or from time to time during the term of the Option (as  prescribed  by Section 3
hereof) shall be as stated below:


    ======================================================================

             VESTING DATE                    CUMULATIVE AGGREGATE
                                           NUMBER OF OPTIONED SHARES
                                            PURCHASABLE ON OR AFTER
                                              THE INDICATED DATE

    ======================================================================

        Date of this Agreement                         o

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                  o                                    o
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                  o                                    o
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

                  o                                    o

    ======================================================================


                  Further, for greater certainty,  the Optionee may purchase all
or any part of the Optioned  Shares not  theretofore  purchased by him or her at
any time or from time to time on or after o and on or prior to the  Expiry  Date
(subject to earlier termination in accordance with the provisions of Sections 5,
6, 7, 8 and 9 hereof and the provisions of the Plan).

5.       TERMINATION OF OPTION RIGHTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

                  Subject  to  the  immediately  following  paragraph,   if  the
Optionee shall:  (i) retire,  resign,  be terminated or otherwise  involuntarily
removed from his employment,  office,  directorship  or consulting  relationship
with  the  Company  or any  Affiliate,  as the  case  may  be;  or  (ii) if such
employment,  office,  directorship  or consulting  relationship  shall otherwise
terminate  (including as a result of death or  Disability) at any time while the
Optionee holds the Option which has not been fully  exercised,  the Optionee may
thereafter  only  exercise the Option at any time on or prior to the earlier of:
(i) the Expiry  Date;  or (ii) the close of business on the day which is 30 days
from  the  date  of  termination  of the  employment,  office,  directorship  or
consulting  relationship  in  question  (one  calendar  year  in  the  event  of
termination  due to death or  Disability),  however the Option may be  exercised
only to the same extent to which the Optionee  could have  exercised  the Option
immediately  before the date on which such employment,  office,  directorship or
consulting  relationship  shall have terminated,  in accordance with the vesting
rules prescribed by Section 4 hereof.

                  However,  if the Optionee otherwise remains an Eligible Person
(i.e. the Optionee or related Eligible Individual  otherwise remains eligible to
participate in the Plan as a result of other directorship, office, employment or
consulting  relationship),  and provided that the


<PAGE>


                                     - 4 -


termination  of  employment  or  other  relationship  was  not for  "cause"  (as
construed under the laws of the Province of Ontario,  including  pursuant to any
relevant  employment or service contract),  then the term of the Option shall be
unaffected.  For purposes of this paragraph, a determination by the Company that
the Optionee was discharged or other  relationship  terminated for "cause" shall
be binding upon the Optionee.

6.       EFFECT OF EMPLOYER CEASING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY

                  If the  Optionee is an Eligible  Person  solely as a result of
being (or the related Eligible Individual being) a director,  officer,  employee
or consultant of an Affiliate of the Company and such Affiliate  ceases to be an
Affiliate  while  the  Optionee  holds  the  Option  which  has not  been  fully
exercised,  then,  provided  that the  Optionee  does not  otherwise  remain  an
Eligible  Person,  the Optionee may  thereafter  only  exercise the Option on or
prior to the earlier of: (i) the Expiry  Date;  or (ii) the close of business on
the day  which is 30 days  from the date  (the  "Severance  Date")  on which the
Affiliate  ceased to be an Affiliate  of the Company,  however the Option may be
exercised only to the same extent to which the Optionee could have exercised the
Option  immediately  before the Severance  Date, in accordance  with the vesting
rules prescribed by Section 4 hereof.

7.       DISCRETION TO EXTEND EARLY TERMINATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

                  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Sections 5 and 6 hereof,
subject to the receipt of all required  regulatory  approvals,  the Board or the
Committee  may elect to extend the term of the Option  from the date on which it
would otherwise have expired  pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 or Section
6 hereof to a date no later than the earlier of: (i) the Expiry  Date;  and (ii)
the  close of  business  on the day which is one year from the date on which the
directorship,  office, employment or consulting relationship of the Optionee (or
the related  Eligible  Individual) is terminated,  for purposes of Section 5, or
one year from the Severance Date, for purposes of Section 6.

                  Such  authority  of the  Board or the  Committee  shall not be
considered an  entitlement of the Optionee and may be exercised or not exercised
by the Board or the Committee in their sole and absolute  discretion  and may be
subject to such conditions or policies as they may implement from time to time.

8.       BANKRUPTCY

                  In the event that the Optionee commits an act of bankruptcy or
any  proceeding  is commenced  against the  Optionee  under the  BANKRUPTCY  AND
INSOLVENCY ACT (Canada) or other applicable bankruptcy or insolvency legislation
in force at the time of such bankruptcy and such proceeding remains  undismissed
or unstayed for a period of 30 days, the Optionee may  thereafter  only exercise
the Option at any time on or prior to the  earlier of: (i) the Expiry  Date;  or

9.       SALE OR REORGANIZATION

   (a)   If, prior to the Expiry Date,  an offeror is entitled to acquire all of
         the remaining shares held by dissenting  offerees,  upon complying with
         the provisions of Section 188 of the BUSINESS  CORPORATIONS ACT, R.S.O.
         1990,  c. B.16  (Ontario) as amended or  substituted  from time to time
         (the  "Legislation")  then the  Board  may,  notwithstanding  the terms
         hereof,  resolve that the Option hereby  granted may be exercised as to
         any or all of the  Optioned  Shares in respect of which such Option has
         not previously been  exercised;  provided,  however,  that the right to
         acquire  Optioned  Shares  may only be  exercised  by the  Optionee  as
         aforesaid for a period expiring on the earlier of: (i) the Expiry Date;
         and (ii) the close of  business  on the day which 30 days from the date
         of the offeror's notice as contemplated  under Subsection 188(2) of the
         Legislation.  In this  Subsection  9(a), all terms which are defined or
         have meanings  attributed  thereto  shall take their  meanings from the
         provisions hereof or from the Legislation.  For greater certainty,  the
         Company may  accelerate  the time for the exercise of the Option hereby
         granted in other circumstances in accordance with the provisions of the
         Plan.

   (b)   If: (i) the Company  proposes to enter into a transaction  contemplated
         in Subsection  182(1) of the Legislation;  (ii) the Company proposes to
         make an issuer bid directed to all or substantially  all holders of its
         shares  or  proposes  to enter  into a  merger,  amalgamation  or other
         corporate  arrangement or reorganization  or to liquidate,  dissolve or
         wind-up;  (iii) an offer to purchase  all or  substantially  all of the
         outstanding  shares of the  Company is made by a third  party;  or (iv)
         there occurs or is proposed a sale or transfer of all, or substantially
         all, of the undertaking,  property or assets of the Company,  the Board
         may,  with  appropriate  notice  and in a fair  and  equitable  manner,
         determine  (unconditionally  or conditionally)  the manner in which all
         unexercised Option rights granted hereunder shall be treated including,
         for example, requiring the acceleration of the time for the exercise of
         such rights by the Optionee and of the time for the  fulfilment  of any
         conditions or restrictions on such exercise,  and/or declaring that the
         Option hereby granted shall be automatically  vested and exercisable in
         full. All  determinations of the Board under this Subsection 9(b) shall
         be conclusive and final.

10.      EXERCISE OF OPTION

                  Subject  to the  provisions  hereof  and the Plan,  the Option
hereby  granted  shall  be  exercisable,  at any  time or  from  time to time as
aforesaid,  by the Optionee,  or in the case of the Optionee's death, his or her
legal personal representatives, heirs or legatees delivering a notice in writing
addressed  to the  Director,  Human  Resources  of the Company at its  principal
office in the City of Toronto,  Ontario  (or to such other  person or address as
the Company may in writing  direct),  which  notice  shall  specify  therein the
number of  Optioned  Shares in respect of which this  Option is being  exercised
and, subject to Section 11 hereof, which shall be accompanied by payment in full
of the purchase price for the number of Optioned Shares specified therein.  Upon


<PAGE>


                                     - 6 -


any such exercise of this Option as aforesaid  (and provided that all applicable
terms and provisions of the Plan and this Agreement  have been  satisfied),  the
Company  shall cause the transfer  agent and registrar of the Company to deliver
to the Optionee, his or her legal personal representatives, heirs or legatees or
(subject to the Plan and applicable law and regulatory  requirements) as he, she
or they may  otherwise  direct in the  notice of  exercise  of  option,  a share
certificate  or  certificates  in the name of the  Optionee  or his or her legal
personal representatives, heirs or legatees, or as he or they may have otherwise
directed,  representing in the aggregate such number of Optioned Shares as shall
have been specified in such notice and paid for.

                  An Optionee  shall not have any rights as a shareholder of the
Company with respect to any of the Shares  covered by such Option until the date
of  issuance  of the Shares on the  records  of the  Company  maintained  by its
Registrar  and Transfer  Agent upon the  exercise of such Option,  in full or in
part, and then only with respect to the Shares being issued.  Without in any way
limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing,  no  adjustment  shall be made for
dividends  or other  rights for which the record  date is prior to the date such
Shares are issued.

11.      CONSIDERATION

                  The Optionee  may satisfy the purchase  price for the Optioned
Shares in respect of which an Option is exercised by:

   (a)            cash;

   (b)            certified cheque;

   (c)            bank draft;

   (d)            subject to the prior  consent  of the Board or the  Committee,

                  attestation  of  ownership of Shares as the Board or Committee
                  may  require   (including   withholding  of  Shares  otherwise
                  deliverable  upon  exercise of the Option) which have a Market
                  Price on the date of  surrender  or  attestation  equal to the
                  aggregate Option Price of the Shares as to which the Option is
                  exercised  (but only to the extent  that such  exercise of the
                  Option would not result in a compensation charge for financial
                  reporting  purposes with respect to the Shares used to pay the
                  exercise price,  unless  otherwise  determined by the Board or
                  Committee);

    (e)           subject to the prior  consent  of the Board or the  Committee,
                  payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance  procedure
                  (including, if approved by the Board and subject to regulatory
                  approval,  a loan  facility  to be  provided  by the  Company)
                  pursuant  to which the  Optionee:  (i) shall  provide  written
                  instructions  to the  Company  designated  brokerage  firm  to
                  effect  the  immediate  sale of  some or all of the  purchased
                  Shares  and  remit to the  Company,  out of the sale  proceeds
                  available on the settlement  date,  sufficient  funds to cover
                  the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased Shares;
                  and (ii) shall  provide  written  directions to the


<PAGE>


                                     - 7 -

                  Company to deliver the  certificates  for the purchased Shares
                  directly to such  brokerage firm in order to complete the sale
                  transaction; or

   (f)            any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

Canadians as consideration  for Shares shall be denominated in Canadian dollars;
cash,  certified  cheques and bank drafts provided by all other Optionees may be
denominated in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars.  The Board or the Committee may
prescribe  one or more  published  exchange  rates  for use in  connection  with
exercises using a currency other than the one specified in the grant agreement.

12.      NO OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE

                  Nothing herein  contained or  contemplated  shall obligate the
Optionee to purchase and/or pay for any Optioned  Shares,  except those Optioned
Shares in  respect of which the  Optionee  shall  have  exercised  his option to
purchase hereunder in the manner hereinbefore provided.

13.      SUBDIVISION, CONSOLIDATION OR AMALGAMATION

     (a)          In  the  event  of  any  subdivision,   redivision,  or  other
                  alteration  of the share capital of the Company at any time at
                  which  the  Option  granted  hereby  shall be  exercisable  in
                  accordance  with  the  foregoing  which  change  results  in a
                  greater number of Shares,  the Company shall  deliver,  at the
                  time of any subsequent  exercise of the Option hereby granted,
                  such  additional  number of Shares as would have resulted from
                  such  subdivision,  redivision,  or change  if the  particular
                  exercise of the Option  hereby  granted had been made prior to
                  the date of such subdivision, redivision, or change.

    (b)           In the event of any  consolidation  or other alteration of the
                  share  capital of the  Company at any time at which the Option
                  granted  hereby shall be  exercisable  in accordance  with the
                  foregoing  which change  results in a lesser number of Shares,
                  the  number  of  Shares  deliverable  by  the  Company  on any
                  subsequent  exercise  of the Option  hereby  granted  shall be
                  reduced to such number of Shares as would have  resulted  from
                  such consolidation or change if the particular exercise of the
                  Option hereby  granted had been made prior to the date of such
                  consolidation or change.

   (c)            In the event of any  consolidation,  merger or amalgamation of
                  the Company  with or into  another  corporation,  the Optionee
                  shall, after such  consolidation,  merger or amalgamation,  be
                  entitled to receive  upon any  exercise  of the Option  hereby
                  granted after the  consolidation,  merger or amalgamation,  in
                  lieu of Shares of the Company,  the number and class of shares
                  or other  securities of the  corporation  continuing from such
                  amalgamation to which he would have been entitled  pursuant to
                  the   agreement   of   amalgamation   (or   other   applicable
                  documentation,

                                     - 8 -


                  however   designated)   if,  at  the  effective  date  of  the
                  consolidation,  merger or amalgamation,  the Optionee had been
                  the  holder of  record  of a number  of Shares of the  Company
                  equal to the number of Shares in respect of which such  Option
                  was then being exercised.

    (d)           In the event that the foregoing  provisions of this Section 13
                  become applicable, the purchase price per Optioned Share shall
                  be proportionately adjusted.

14.      NO ADDITIONAL RIGHTS IMPLIED

                  The Optionee shall have no rights  whatsoever as a shareholder
of the  Company  in respect  of any  Optioned  Shares  (including,  but  without
limitation,  any  voting  rights  or any  right to  receive  dividends  or other
distributions  therefrom or thereon),  other than in respect of Optioned  Shares
for which the Optionee  shall have  exercised  the Option and which the Optionee
shall have actually taken up and paid for.

                  Nothing in the Plan or in this Agreement shall confer upon the
Optionee  any right to  continue  or be  re-elected  as a  director,  officer or
consultant or confer any right to continue in the employ,  of the Company or any
Affiliate,  or affect in any way the right of the  Company or any  Affiliate  to
terminate his  employment  or to terminate  any contract at any time;  nor shall
anything in the Plan or in this  Agreement be deemed or construed to  constitute
an  agreement,  or an  expression  of intent,  on the part of the Company or any
Affiliate  to extend the  employment,  or  office,  directorship  or  consulting
relationship  of any Optionee beyond the time which he would normally be retired
pursuant to the provisions of any present or future retirement plan or policy of
any such  entity  or  beyond  the time at which he would  otherwise  be  retired
pursuant to the provisions of any contract of employment with any such entity.

                  Except as shall be  specifically  provided in the  contract of
employment or contract for provision of services,  the granting of Options is at
the full discretion of the Company and shall, therefore,  not qualify as part of
the terms of employment of the Optionee.  In consideration  for the grant of the
Option,  the Optionee  acknowledges and agrees that the value or potential value
of the Option  hereby  granted  which is  forfeited  as a result of the Optionee
(including,  without limitation,  the related Eligible Individual) ceasing to be
an Eligible Person, shall not constitute damages in respect of loss of office or
employment and no claim may be made by or on behalf of the Optionee  against the
Company or any of its Affiliates in respect thereof.

15.      TIME OF THE ESSENCE

                  Time shall be of the  essence of this  Agreement  and of every
part hereof.
