OFFER TO PURCHASE $50,000,000 IN OUTSTANDING<BR>
LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTERESTS AT NET ASSET VALUE<BR>
DATED NOVEMBER 24, 2003<BR>
<BR>
THE OFFER AND WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS WILL EXPIRE AT<BR>
12:00 MIDNIGHT, NEW YORK TIME, ON TUESDAY, DECEMBER 23, 2003,<BR>
UNLESS THE OFFER IS EXTENDED</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>To the Investors of<BR>
UBS Credit &amp; Recovery Fund, L.L.C.:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
UBS Credit &amp; Recovery
Fund, L.L.C., a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company
organized as a Delaware limited liability company (the &quot;Fund&quot;), is
offering to purchase for cash on the terms and conditions set forth in this
offer to purchase (&quot;Offer to Purchase&quot;) and the related Letter of
Transmittal (which together with the Offer to Purchase constitutes the
&quot;Offer&quot;) up to $50,000,000 in interests in the Fund (the
&quot;Interests&quot;) or portions thereof pursuant to tenders by investors at a
price equal to their estimated net asset value as of December 31, 2003, if the
Offer expires on December 23, 2003. If the Fund elects to extend the tender
period for any reason, for the purpose of determining the purchase price for
tendered Interests, the estimated net asset value of such Interests will be
determined at the close of business on the last business day of the month in
which the tender offer actually expires. (As used in this Offer, the term
&quot;Interest,&quot; or &quot;Interests,&quot; as the context requires, shall
refer to the interests in the Fund and portions thereof representing beneficial
interests in the Fund.) This Offer is being made to all investors of the Fund
and is not conditioned on any minimum amount of Interests being tendered, but is
subject to certain conditions described below. Interests are not traded on any
established trading market and are subject to strict restrictions on
transferability pursuant to the Fund's Limited Liability Company Agreement dated
as of May 9, 2002 (the &quot;L.L.C. Agreement&quot;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investors should realize
that the value of the Interests tendered in this Offer likely will change
between October 31, 2003 (the last time estimated net asset value was
calculated) and November 30, 2003 (the next time estimated net asset value will
be calculated) and December 31, 2003, when the value of the Interests tendered
to the Fund will be determined for purposes of calculating the purchase price of
such Interests. Investors should also note that although the tender offer
expires on December 23, 2003, they remain investors in the Fund until December
31, 2003, when the estimated net asset value of their Interests is calculated.
The Fund determines the estimated net asset value at least monthly, based on the
information it receives from the managers of the investment funds in which it
invests, and may determine the estimated net asset value more frequently. Any
tendering investors that wish to obtain the most current estimated net asset
value of their Interests on this basis should contact PFPC Inc., at the
telephone number or address set forth below, Monday through Friday, except
holidays, during normal business hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Investors desiring to
tender all or any portion of their Interest in the Fund in accordance with the
terms of the Offer should complete and sign the attached Letter of Transmittal
(the last page will suffice) and mail or fax it to the Fund in the manner set
forth below. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=3><B>IMPORTANT</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Neither the Fund nor the Adviser nor any of the Directors
makes any recommendation to any investor as to whether to tender or refrain from
tendering Interests. Investors must make their own decisions whether to tender
Interests, and, if so, the portion of their Interests to tender.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>Because each investor's
investment decision is a personal one, based on its financial circumstances, no
person has been authorized to make any recommendation on behalf of the Fund as
to whether investors should tender Interests pursuant to the Offer. No person
has been authorized to give any information or to make any representations in
connection with the Offer other than those contained herein or in the Letter of
Transmittal. If given or made, such recommendation and such information and
representations must not be relied on as having been authorized by the Fund.</B> </FONT></P>

<B>This transaction has not
been approved or disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission nor has
the Securities and Exchange Commission or any state securities commission passed
on the fairness or merits of such transaction or on the accuracy or adequacy of
the information contained in this document. Any representation to the contrary
is unlawful.</B> </FONT></P>

As we said in your Fund's offering documents, we will buy your Interests at
their estimated net asset value (that is, the estimated value of the Fund's
assets minus its liabilities, multiplied by the proportionate interest in the
Fund you desire to sell). This offer will remain open until midnight on December
23, 2003. Estimated net asset value will be calculated for this purpose on
December 31, 2003.

To make sure we have calculated net asset value correctly, we will check it
during the Fund's audit for calendar year 2003, which we expect will be
completed in February 2004. If you tender your entire interest in the Fund, we
will pay you in cash by approximately January 9, 2004, 95% of our calculation of
the estimated net asset value as of December 31, 2003. We will owe you the
balance, for which we will give you a promissory note that will be held for you
by the Fund's Administrator, PFPC Inc. (&quot;PFPC&quot;). If you tender part of
your interest, leaving a remainder at least equal to $50,000 ($25,000 for
certain eligible investors who are identified in the Confidential Memorandum of
the Fund), we will pay all your proceeds in cash by approximately January 9th.
We will obtain the cash to pay you, either from cash on hand, selling portfolio
securities or through borrowings (which we do not intend to do).

Following this summary is a formal notice of our offer to purchase your
Interests. Our offer remains open to you until midnight on December 23, 2003.
Until this time, you have the right to change your mind and withdraw your
Interests from consideration for purchase. If we do not accept your interests by
midnight, December 23, 2003, you may still withdraw your Interests at any time
after January 23, 2004, assuming your offer has not been accepted. </TD>

If you would like us to purchase your Interests, you should mail or fax a Letter
of Transmittal (the last page of the letter will suffice), enclosed with our
offer, to PFPC at the address/fax number listed on page 2 of this Offer to
Purchase, so that it is received before midnight, December 23, 2003. If you
choose to fax the Letter of Transmittal, you should mail the original last page
of the Letter of Transmittal to PFPC promptly after you fax it (although the
original page does not have to be received before midnight, December 23, 2003).
Of course, the value of your Interests is likely to change between October 31,
2003 (the last time estimated net asset value was calculated) and November 30,
2003 (the next time it will be calculated) and December 31, 2003, when the
estimated value of your investment will be determined for purposes of
calculating your purchase price. The net asset value of your Interests is
determined at least monthly and may be determined more frequently. </TD>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Background and Purpose of the Offer</B>. The
purpose of the Offer is to provide liquidity to investors who hold Interests as
contemplated by and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Confidential Memorandum of UBS Credit &amp; Recovery Fund, L.L.C., dated June 2002
(the "Confidential Memorandum"), and the L.L.C. Agreement. The Confidential
Memorandum and the L.L.C. Agreement, which were provided to each investor in
advance of subscribing for Interests, provide that the Directors have the
discretion to determine whether the Fund will purchase Interests from investors
from time to time pursuant to written tenders. The Confidential Memorandum also
states that UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C., the adviser of the Fund (the "Adviser"),
expects that generally it will recommend to the Directors that the Fund
repurchase Interests from investors in December 2003 and, thereafter, once each
year in December. Because there is no secondary trading market for Interests and
transfers of Interests are prohibited without prior approval of the Fund, the
Directors have determined, after consideration of various matters, including,
but not limited to, those set forth in the Confidential Memorandum, that the
Offer is in the best interests of investors of the Fund to provide liquidity for
Interests as contemplated in the Confidential Memorandum and the L.L.C.
Agreement. The Directors intend to consider the continued desirability of the
Fund making an offer to purchase Interests once each year, but the Fund is not
required to make any such offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purchase of Interests pursuant to the Offer
will have the effect of decreasing the size of the Fund and increasing the
proportionate interest in the Fund of investors who do not tender Interests. A
reduction in the aggregate assets of the Fund may result in investors who do not
tender Interests bearing higher costs to the extent that certain expenses borne
by the Fund are relatively fixed and may not decrease if assets decline. These
effects may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that additional subscriptions
for Interests are made from time to time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Interests that are tendered
to the Fund in connection with this Offer will be retired, although the Fund may
issue new Interests from time to time in transactions not involving any public
offering conducted pursuant to Rule&#160;506 of Regulation&#160;D under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Offer to Purchase and Price</B>. The Fund will
purchase, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, up to
$50,000,000 of those outstanding Interests that are properly tendered by and not
withdrawn (in accordance with Section 5 below) before 12:00 midnight, New York
time, on Tuesday, December 23, 2003 (such time and date being hereinafter called
the "Initial Expiration Date"). If the Fund elects to extend the tender period
for any reason, for the purpose of determining the purchase price for tendered
Interests, the estimated net asset value of such Interests will be determined at
the close of business on the last business day of the month in which the tender
offer actually expires. The later of the Initial Expiration Date or the latest
time and date to which the Offer is extended hereinafter is called the
"Expiration Date." The Fund reserves the right to extend, amend or cancel the
Offer as described in Sections 3 and 7 below. The purchase price of an Interest
tendered will be its estimated net asset value as of the close of business on
the last day of the month in which the Expiration Date occurs, payable as set
forth in Section 6. The table below shows the estimated unaudited net asset
value, as of November 1, 2003, of an initial capital contribution of $250,000
made as of the dates on which initial investments in the Fund were accepted:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of November 1, 2003, there were approximately
$110,365,391 outstanding in capital of the Fund held in Interests (based on the
unaudited estimated net asset value of such Interests). The Fund determines its
estimated net asset value at least monthly, based on information it receives
from the managers of the investment funds in which it invests, and may determine
its estimated net asset value more frequently. Investors may obtain the most
current information regarding the estimated net asset value of their Interests
by contacting PFPC, at the telephone number or address set forth on page 2,
Monday through Friday, except holidays, during normal business hours of 9:00
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time). Of course, the value of the Interests tendered
by the investors likely will change between October 31, 2003 (the last time
estimated net asset value was calculated) and November 30, 2003 (the next time
it will be calculated) and December 31, 2003, when the value of the Interests
tendered by investors will be determined for purposes of calculating the
purchase price of such Interests and the time that investors will cease to be
investors in the Fund. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Amount of Tender</B>. Subject to the limitations
set forth below, investors may tender their entire Interest or a portion of
their Interest. However, an investor who tenders for repurchase only a portion
of such investor's Interest shall be required to maintain a capital account
balance equal to $50,000 ($25,000 for certain eligible investors who are
identified in the Fund's Confidential Memorandum). If an investor tenders an
amount that would cause the investor's capital account balance to fall below the
required minimum, the Fund reserves the right to reduce the amount to be
purchased from such investor so that the required minimum balance is maintained.
The Offer is being made to all investors of the Fund and is not conditioned on
any minimum amount of Interests being tendered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the amount of the Interests that are properly
tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn pursuant to Section 5 below is
less than or equal to $50,000,000 (or such greater amount as the Fund may elect
to purchase pursuant to the Offer), the Fund will, on the terms and subject to
the conditions of the Offer, purchase all of the Interests so tendered unless
the Fund elects to cancel or amend the Offer, or postpone acceptance of tenders
made pursuant to the Offer, as provided in Section 7 below. If more than
$50,000,000 in Interests are duly tendered to the Fund before the expiration of
the Offer and not withdrawn pursuant to Section 5 below, the Fund will, in its
sole discretion, either (a) accept the additional Interests permitted to be
accepted pursuant to Rule 13e-4(f)(1)(ii) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended; (b) extend the Offer, if necessary, and increase the amount of
Interests that the Fund is offering to purchase to an amount it believes
sufficient to accommodate the excess Interests tendered as well as any Interests
tendered during the extended Offer; or (c) accept Interests tendered on or
before the Expiration Date for payment on a pro rata basis based on the
aggregate estimated net asset value of tendered Interests. The Offer may be
extended, amended or canceled in various other circumstances described in
Section 7 below. The Adviser beneficially owns $1,216,312 in Interests and
intends to tender substantially all of its Interests in the Offer, except for
approximately $15,000 in Interests. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       <B>Procedure for Tenders</B>.  Investors wishing to tender Interests pursuant to the Offer should mail a completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal (the last page will suffice) to PFPC, to the attention of
Tender Offer Administrator, at the address set forth on page 2, or fax a
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal to PFPC, also to the attention of
Tender Offer Administrator, at the fax numbers set forth on page 2. The
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal must be received by PFPC, either by
mail or by fax, no later than the Expiration Date. The Fund recommends that all
documents be submitted to PFPC by certified mail, return receipt requested, or
by facsimile transmission. An investor choosing to fax a Letter of Transmittal
to PFPC must also mail the original completed and executed Letter of Transmittal
(the last page will suffice) to PFPC promptly thereafter. If an investor elects
to tender, it is the tendering investor's responsibility to confirm receipt of
the Letter of Transmittal or other document with PFPC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investors wishing to confirm receipt of a Letter
of Transmittal may contact PFPC at the address and phone number set forth on
page 2. The&#160;method of delivery of any documents is at the election and
complete risk of the investor tendering an Interest, including, but not limited
to, the failure of PFPC to receive any Letter of Transmittal or other document.
All questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt)
and acceptance of tenders will be determined by the Fund, in its sole
discretion, and such determination shall be final and binding. The Fund reserves
the absolute right to reject any or all tenders determined by it not to be in
appropriate form or the acceptance of or payment for which would, in the opinion
of counsel for the Fund, be unlawful. The Fund also reserves the absolute right
to waive any of the conditions of the Offer or any defect in any tender with
respect to any particular Interest or any particular investor, and the Fund's
interpretation of the terms and conditions of the Offer will be final and
binding. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in connection with tenders
must be cured within such time as the Fund shall determine. Tenders will not be
deemed to have been made until the defects or irregularities have been cured or
waived. Neither the Fund nor the Adviser nor Directors of the Fund shall be
obligated to give notice of any defects or irregularities in tenders, nor shall
any of them incur any liability for failure to give such notice. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Withdrawal Rights</B>. Any investor
tendering an Interest pursuant to this Offer may withdraw its tender at any time
on or before the Expiration Date and, if Interests have not then been accepted
by the Fund, at any time after January 23, 2004. To be effective, any notice of
withdrawal must be timely received by PFPC at the address or fax numbers set
forth on page 2. A form to use to give notice of withdrawal is available by
calling PFPC at the phone number indicated on page 2. All questions as to the
form and validity (including time of receipt) of notices of withdrawal will be
determined by the Fund, in its sole discretion, and such determination shall be
final and binding. Interests properly withdrawn shall not thereafter be deemed
to be tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Interests may be
tendered prior to the Expiration Date by following the procedures described in
Section 4.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Purchases and Payment</B>. For purposes of
the Offer, the Fund will be deemed to have accepted (and thereby purchased)
Interests that are tendered as, if and when it gives oral or written notice to
the tendering investor of its election to purchase such Interest. As stated in
Section 2 above, the purchase price of an Interest tendered by any investor will
be the estimated net asset value thereof as of the close of business on December
31, 2003, if the Offer expires on the Initial Expiration Date. If the Fund
elects to extend the tender period for any reason, for the purpose of
determining the purchase price for tendered Interests, the estimated net asset
value of such Interests will be determined at the close of business on the last
business day of the month in which the tender offer actually expires. The
estimated net asset value will be determined after all allocations to capital
accounts of the investors required to be made by the L.L.C.
Agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For investors who tender their entire Interest,
payment of the purchase price will consist of: (1) cash in an aggregate amount
equal to 95% of the estimated unaudited net asset value of Interests tendered by
the investor and accepted by the Fund, determined as of December 31, 2003,
payable by approximately January 9, 2004 (the &quot;95% Cash Payment&quot;) and
(2)&#160;a promissory note (the &quot;Note&quot;), entitling the holder thereof
to a contingent payment equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the net asset value
of the Interests tendered by the investor and accepted by the Fund as of the
Expiration Date, determined as of December 31, 2003, based on the audited
financial statements of the Fund for calendar year 2003, over (b) the 95% Cash
Payment. The Note will be held for each tendering investor by PFPC as set forth
below, will be prepared within approximately ten days after the Fund's estimated
net asset value is calculated and will not be transferable. The Note will be
payable in cash (in the manner set forth below) within approximately ten days
after completion of the audit of the financial statements of the Fund for
calendar year 2003, or on such earlier date as the Fund's Directors may
determine. It is anticipated that the audit of the Fund's financial statements
for calendar year 2003 will be completed by no later than 60 days after the end
of the year. Any amounts payable under the Note will include interest, if any,
earned by the Fund on an amount, deposited by the Fund in a segregated custodial
account, equal to 5% of the estimated unaudited net asset value of Interests
tendered by the investor and accepted by the Fund. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investors who tender a portion of their Interests
(subject to maintenance of a minimum capital account balance) will receive cash
in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the estimated unaudited net asset value
of Interests tendered by the investor and accepted by the Fund, determined as of
December 31, 2003, payable by approximately January 9, 2004 (the &quot;100% Cash
Payment&quot;). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the 95% Cash Payment and the 100% Cash
Payment (together, the &quot;Cash Payment&quot;) will be made by wire transfer
directly to the tendering investor's brokerage account with UBS Financial
Services Inc. (&quot;UBS Financial Services&quot;) if such investor has a UBS
Financial Services account. Cash Payments wired directly to brokerage accounts
will be subject upon withdrawal from such accounts to any fees that UBS
Financial Services would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from
such brokerage account. If such investor does not have a UBS Financial Services
account, the Cash Payment will be sent directly to its mailing address as listed
in the Fund's records, unless such investor advises the Fund in writing of a
change in its mailing address. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Note will be held for each investor by the
Fund's Administrator, PFPC. Any contingent payment due pursuant to the Note will
be deposited directly to the tendering investor's brokerage account at UBS
Financial Services if such investor has a UBS Financial Services account, and
will be subject upon withdrawal from such account to any fees that UBS Financial
Services would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from such
brokerage account. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fund expects that the purchase price for
Interests acquired pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, which will not exceed
$50,000,000 (unless the Fund elects, in its sole and absolute discretion, to
purchase a greater amount), will be derived from: (1) cash on hand; (2) the
proceeds of the sale of and/or delivery of securities and portfolio assets held
by the Fund; and/or (3) possibly borrowings, as described below. The Fund will
segregate, with its custodian, cash or U.S. government securities or other
liquid securities equal to the value of the amount estimated to be paid under
any Notes as described above. Neither the Fund nor the Adviser nor Directors
have determined at this time to borrow funds to purchase Interests in connection
with the Offer to Purchase. However, depending on the dollar amount of Interests
tendered and prevailing general economic and market conditions, the Fund, in its
sole discretion, may decide to seek to borrow money to fund all or a portion of
the purchase price. No borrowing facilities have been entered into to date.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Certain Conditions of the Offer</B>. The
Fund reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, to extend the period
of time during which the Offer is pending by notifying investors of such
extension. If the Fund elects to extend the tender period for any reason, for
the purpose of determining the purchase price for tendered Interests, the
estimated net asset value of such Interests will be determined at the close of
business on the last business day of the month in which the tender offer
actually expires. During any such extension, all Interests previously tendered
and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer. The Fund also reserves the
right, at any time and from time to time, up to and including acceptance of
tenders pursuant to the Offer, to: (a) cancel the Offer in the circumstances set
forth in the following paragraph and in the event of such cancellation, not to
purchase or pay for any Interests tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b) amend the
Offer; or (c) postpone the acceptance of Interests. If the Fund determines to
amend the Offer or to postpone the acceptance of Interests tendered, it will, to
the extent necessary, extend the period of time during which the Offer is open
as provided above and will promptly notify investors.</FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fund may cancel the Offer, amend the Offer or
postpone the acceptance of tenders made pursuant to the Offer if: (a) the Fund
would not be able to liquidate portfolio securities in a manner that is orderly
and consistent with the Fund's investment objectives and policies in order to
purchase Interests tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b) there is, in the
Directors' judgment, any (i) legal action or proceeding instituted or threatened
challenging the Offer or that otherwise would have a material adverse affect on
the Fund, (ii) declaration of a banking moratorium by Federal or state
authorities or any suspension of payment by banks in the United States or New
York State that is material to the Fund, (iii) limitation imposed by Federal or
state authorities on the extension of credit by lending institutions, (iv)
suspension of trading on any organized exchange or over-the-counter market where
the Fund has a material investment, (v) commencement of war, armed hostilities
or other international or national calamity directly or indirectly involving the
United States that is material to the Fund, (vi) material decrease in the
estimated net asset value of the Fund from the estimated net asset value of the
Fund as of the commencement of the Offer, or (vii)&#160;other event or condition
that would have a material adverse effect on the Fund or its investors if
Interests tendered pursuant to the Offer were purchased; or (c) the independent
Directors of the Fund determine that it is not in the best interest of the Fund
to purchase Interests pursuant to the Offer. However, there can be no assurance
that the Fund will exercise its right to extend, amend or cancel the Offer or to
postpone acceptance of tenders pursuant to the Offer. If conditions qualifying
as war or armed hostilities as expressed in Section 7(b)(v) above occur (and, at
present, the Fund does not believe these conditions exist), and the Directors
waive the Fund's rights under Section 7, they will determine whether such waiver
constitutes a material change to the Offer. If they determine that it does, the
Offer will remain open for at least five business days following the waiver and
investors will be notified of this occurrence. </FONT></P>

Feldberg, George W. Gowen and M. Cabell Woodward, Jr. Their address is c/o UBS
Financial Services Inc., attention: Alternative Investment Group, at 1285 Avenue

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fund does not have any plans or proposals
that relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition by any person of
additional Interests (other than the Fund's intention to accept subscriptions
for Interests from time to time in the discretion of the Fund) or the
disposition of Interests, other than as disclosed in the Confidential
Memorandum; (b) an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, reorganization
or liquidation, involving the Fund; (c) any material change in the present
distribution policy or indebtedness or capitalization of the Fund; (d) any
change in the identity of the Adviser or Directors of the Fund, or in the
management of the Fund including, but not limited to, any plans or proposals to
change the number or the term of the Directors of the Fund, to fill any existing
vacancy for a Director of the Fund or to change any material term of the
investment advisory arrangements with the Adviser, except that M. Cabell
Woodward, Jr. has advised the Fund of his intention to retire as a Director some
time during early- or mid-2004; the Fund's &quot;disinterested directors&quot;
(as such term is defined in the 1940 Act), acting as a nominating committee,
will seek to nominate a replacement to fill Mr. Woodward's vacancy as well as
perhaps nominate an additional Director to the Board who would be a
representative of the Adviser; (e) a sale or transfer of a material amount of
assets of the Fund (other than as the Directors determine may be necessary or
appropriate to fund any portion of the purchase price for Interests acquired
pursuant to this Offer to Purchase or in connection with the ordinary portfolio
transactions of the Fund); (f) any other material change in the Fund's structure
or business, including any plans or proposals to make any changes in its
fundamental investment policy for which a vote would be required by
Section&#160;13 of the 1940 Act; or (g) any changes in the L.L.C. Agreement or
other actions that may impede the acquisition of control of the Fund by any
person. </FONT></P>

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences</B>.
The following discussion is a general summary of the federal income tax
consequences of the purchase of Interests by the Fund from investors pursuant to
the Offer. Investors should consult their own tax advisers for a complete
description of the tax consequences to them of a purchase of their Interests by
the Fund pursuant to the Offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An investor who tenders its entire Interest (and
whose entire interest is accepted) to the Fund for repurchase generally will
recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the
proceeds received by such investor (consisting of the 95% Cash Payment and the
principal payment under the Note) and such investor's adjusted tax basis in its
Interest. Gain, if any, will be recognized by a tendering investor only as and
after the total proceeds received by such investor exceed the investor's
adjusted tax basis in its interest. A loss, if any, may be recognized after the
tendering investor has received payment under the Note. This capital gain or
loss will be short-term or long-term depending upon the investor's holding
period for its Interest at the time the gain or loss is recognized. Treasury
Regulations provide that an investor will have a divided (that is, fragmented)
holding period for its interest if the investor makes contributions to the Fund
at different times. Under the Treasury Regulations, each time the investor makes
a contribution to the Fund, the investor will have a new holding period for that
portion of its Interest determined by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the contribution and the denominator of which is the investor's
capital account immediately after the contribution. Certain cash contributions,
if made within one year of a liquidating distribution, can be netted against the
distribution. If the investor recognizes capital gain or loss in connection with
a complete withdrawal from the Fund, the gain or loss is divided between
long-term and short-term capital gain or loss in the same proportions as the
holding period of the Interest is divided between the portion of the Interest
held for more than one year and the portion of the Interest held for one year or
less. A tendering investor will recognize ordinary income to the extent such
investor's allocable share of the Fund's &quot;unrealized receivables&quot;
exceeds the investor's basis in such unrealized receivables, as determined
pursuant to the Treasury Regulations. For these purposes, accrued but untaxed
market discount if any, on securities held by the Fund will be treated as an
unrealized receivable with respect to the tendering investor. An investor who
tenders less than its entire Interest to the Fund for repurchase will recognize
gain (but not loss) in a similar manner only to the extent that the amount of
the proceeds received (consisting of the 100% Cash Payment) exceeds such
investor's adjusted tax basis in its Interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the authority granted to it under the
L.L.C. Agreement, the Adviser intends to specially allocate items of Fund
capital gain, including short-term capital gain, to a withdrawing investor to
the extent its liquidating distribution would otherwise exceed its adjusted tax
basis in its Interest. Such a special allocation may result in the withdrawing
investor recognizing capital gain, which may include short-term gain, in the
investor's last taxable year in the Fund, thereby potentially reducing the
amount of any long-term capital gain that, absent the special allocation, would
otherwise have been recognized during the tax year in which it receives its
liquidating distribution upon withdrawal. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Treasury Regulations</B>. Recently
promulgated Treasury Regulations require taxpayers that participate in
"reportable transactions" to disclose such participation to the Internal Revenue
Service (the "Service") (by attaching Form 8886 to their tax returns and filing
a copy of that Form with the IRS Office of Tax Shelter Analysis) and comply with
certain document retention requirements. In addition, certain organizers and
sellers of such a transaction are required to maintain records, including lists
identifying investors in the transaction, and must furnish those records to the
Service upon demand. A transaction may be a "reportable transaction" based on
any of several criteria, one or more of which may be present with respect to an
investment in or by the Fund. These regulations are directed towards "tax
shelters," however, they are quite broad and may encompass transactions that
typically would not be considered "tax shelters." Investors should consult their
own tax advisors concerning any possible disclosure obligation they may have
with respect to their investment in the Fund and should be aware that the Fund
(and perhaps other participants in the transaction) intend to comply with the
disclosure and investor list maintenance requirements to the extent the Fund
determines them to apply with respect to this transaction and/or its
investments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision or statement
in any offering document of the Fund (including the Investor Application Form,
the Confidential Memorandum and the L.L.C. Agreement), but subject to
restrictions reasonably necessary to comply with federal or state securities
laws, an investor (and each employee, representative or other agent of the
Investor) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind,
the tax treatment and tax structure of the Fund and the offering of its
interests and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to the investor relating to such tax treatment and
tax structure. For the avoidance of doubt, this authorization is not intended to
permit disclosure of the names of, or other identifying information regarding,
the participants in the transaction, or of any information or the portion of any
materials not relevant to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction.

11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Miscellaneous</B>. The Offer is not being
made to, nor will tenders be accepted from, investors in any jurisdiction in
which the Offer or its acceptance would not comply with the securities or Blue
Sky laws of such jurisdiction. The Fund is not aware of any jurisdiction in
which the Offer or tenders pursuant thereto would not be in compliance with the
laws of such jurisdiction. However, the Fund reserves the right to exclude
investors from the Offer in any jurisdiction in which it is asserted that the
Offer cannot lawfully be made. The Fund believes such exclusion is permissible
under applicable laws and regulations, provided the Fund makes a good faith
effort to comply with any state law deemed applicable to the Offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Ladies and Gentlemen:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The undersigned hereby tenders to UBS Credit &amp; Recovery
Fund, L.L.C., a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (the &quot;Fund&quot;), the
limited liability company interest in the Fund or portion thereof held by the
undersigned, described and specified below, on the terms and conditions set
forth in the offer to purchase, dated November 24, 2003 (&quot;Offer to
Purchase&quot;), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and in this Letter of
Transmittal (which together constituted the &quot;Offer&quot;). <B>The tender
and this Letter of Transmittal are subject to all the terms and conditions set
forth in the Offer to Purchase, including, but not limited to, the absolute
right of the Fund to reject any and all tenders determined by it, in its sole
discretion, not to be in the appropriate form.</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The undersigned hereby sells to the Fund the limited liability company interest
in the Fund or portion thereof tendered hereby pursuant to the Offer. The
undersigned hereby warrants that the undersigned has full authority to sell the
limited liability company interest in the Fund or portion thereof tendered
hereby and that the Fund will acquire good title thereto, free and clear of all
liens, charges, encumbrances, conditional sales agreements or other obligations
relating to the sale thereof, and not subject to any adverse claim, when and to
the extent the same are purchased by it. Upon request, the undersigned will
execute and deliver any additional documents necessary to complete the sale in
accordance with the terms of the Offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The undersigned recognizes that under certain circumstances set forth in the
Offer, the Fund may not be required to purchase any of the limited liability
company interest in the Fund or portions thereof tendered hereby. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>The undersigned acknowledges that the method of delivery of any documents is
at the election and the complete risk of the undersigned, including, but not
limited to, the failure of the Fund's Administrator, PFPC Inc.
(&quot;PFPC&quot;), to receive any Letter of Transmittal or other document.</B>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Payment of the cash portion of the purchase price for the limited liability
company interest in the Fund or portion thereof of the undersigned (the
&quot;Cash Payment&quot;), as described in Section 6 of the Offer to Purchase,
shall be sent to the undersigned by wire transfer to the&#160;undersigned's
brokerage account at UBS Financial Services Inc. (&quot;UBS Financial
Services&quot;) if such investor has a UBS Financial Services account. (The
undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the undersigned understands
that, for cash payments wired directly to an investor's brokerage account, upon
a withdrawal of such cash payment from such account, UBS Financial Services will
impose such fees as it would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from
such brokerage account.) If such investor does not have a UBS Financial Services
account, the Cash Payment will be sent directly to its mailing address as listed
in the Fund's records. A promissory note (&quot;Note&quot;) reflecting the
contingent payment portion of the purchase price, if any, as described in
Section 6 of the Offer to Purchase, will be held for such investor by PFPC. (Any
contingent payment due pursuant to the Note will be deposited directly to the
tendering investor's brokerage account at UBS Financial Services if such
investor has a UBS Financial Services account, and, upon a withdrawal of such
contingent payment from such account, UBS Financial Services will impose such
fees as it would customarily assess upon the withdrawal of cash from such
brokerage account.) The undersigned recognizes that the amount of the Cash
Payment will be based on the unaudited estimated net asset value as of December
31, 2003, of the limited liability company interest or portion thereof tendered,
and that the contingent payment portion of the purchase price, if any, will be
determined upon completion of the audit of the Fund's financial statements for
calendar year 2003, which is anticipated to be completed not later than 60 days
after the Fund's fiscal year end, and will be paid in cash within approximately
ten days thereafter, or on such earlier date as the Fund's Directors may
determine. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Dear Investor:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>UBS Credit &amp; Recovery Fund, L.L.C. (the &quot;Fund&quot;)
has received and accepted your tender request. Enclosed is a statement showing
the breakdown of your capital withdrawal and the manner in which it is being
distributed, in accordance with the tender offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>Since you have tendered your entire investment, you have been
paid 95% of the amount requested, in accordance with the terms of the tender
offer. The funds were wired directly into your UBS Financial Services brokerage
account if you have a UBS Financial Services account. If you do not have a UBS
Financial Services account, the funds were mailed directly in the form of a
check to you at your mailing address as listed in the Fund's records.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=3>The remaining 5% of the amount requested is a contingent portion
of the repurchased interest and is valued based on the unaudited estimated net
asset value of the Fund as of December 31, 2003, and is subject to year-end
audit adjustments which may cause a change in the value of the contingent
portion of the repurchased interest. The contingent portion, together with
interest, will be paid (subject to audit adjustment) within approximately ten
days after the conclusion of the 2003 year-end audit, or on such earlier date as
the Fund's Directors may determine, according to the terms of the tender offer.
We expect the audit to be completed by the end of February 2004. </FONT></P>
