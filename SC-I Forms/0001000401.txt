          must receive these documents prior to the scheduled  expiration of the
          Offer  (currently  Thursday,  September 30, 2004 at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern
          time).

     o    HOW MUCH IS THE FUND  OFFERING TO PAY ME FOR MY SHARES?  The Fund will
          pay you cash in an amount equal to the Fund's net asset value  ("NAV")
          per Share as of the close of business  of the New York Stock  Exchange
          on the expiration date (currently Thursday, September 30, 2004). As of
          July 30, 2004,  the Fund's NAV,  which  fluctuates on a monthly basis,
          was $6.83 per Share. See Section 1 "Price; Number of Shares."

     o    WILL I HAVE TO PAY ANY FEES OR COMMISSION  IF I TENDER MY SHARES?  The
          Fund will not  charge  you a fee if you  tender  your  Shares.  If you
          tender your Shares  through a broker,  dealer or other  nominee,  that
          broker,  dealer or other  nominee may charge you a fee for  processing
          the transaction on your behalf. See Section 2 "Procedure for Tendering
          Shares."

     o    WILL THERE BE ANY TAX  CONSEQUENCES  TO ME IF I TENDER MY  SHARES?  If
          your tendered  Shares are accepted,  it will be a taxable  transaction
          either  in  the  form  of  a  "sale  or  exchange"  or  under  certain
          circumstances  as a  "dividend."  You should  consult your tax advisor
          regarding the tax  consequences  to you of tendering your Shares.  See
          Section 12 "Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences."

     o    WHEN WILL THE OFFER EXPIRE?  HOW WILL I KNOW IF THE OFFERING PERIOD IS
          EXTENDED OR IF THE OFFER IS  TERMINATED?  The Offer expires  Thursday,
          September 30, 2004 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless the Fund notifies
          you that it is either  extending or terminating its Offer. If the Fund
          extends its Offer period, the Fund's public  announcement will be made
          not later than 9:00 a.m. on the next business day after the previously
          scheduled expiration date. See Section 1 "Price; Number of Shares" and
          Section 13 "Extension of Tender Period; Termination; Amendment."

     o    MAY I WITHDRAW MY TENDERED  SHARES?  You may  withdraw  your  tendered
          Shares  at any  time  prior  to the  expiration  date,  which,  unless
          extended,  is  currently  Thursday,  September  30,  2004 at 4:00 p.m.
          Eastern  Time.  Additionally,  if the Fund has not yet  accepted  your
          tendered Shares for payment,  you may withdraw your tendered Shares at
          any time after October 28, 2004. To withdraw your tendered Shares, you
          should contact your financial advisor or other nominee,  or you should
          submit proper written notice to the Fund's Transfer Agent. See Section
          3 "Withdrawal Rights."

     o    DOES THE FUND HAVE THE  FINANCIAL  RESOURCES  TO PAY ME FOR MY SHARES?
          The Fund expects to have adequate money to finance the purchase of its
          tendered Shares. See Section 8 "Source and Amount of Funds."

     o    WHY IS THE FUND  MAKING  AN OFFER TO  PURCHASE  SHARES  OF ITS  COMMON
          STOCK? No established  secondary  trading market  currently exists for
          the Fund's Shares. As a result,  the Fund's Board of Directors decided
          to provide  liquidity for  stockholders  by making an Offer.  The Fund
          cannot assure you that you will be provided with sufficient liquidity,
          or that the Fund  will  make a  similar  tender  Offer in the  future.
          Neither the Fund nor its Board of Directors  makes any  recommendation
          as to whether  or not you should  tender  you  Shares.  See  Section 6
          "Purpose of the Offer."

     o    WHAT ARE THE MOST  SIGNIFICANT  CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER?  The Offer is
          not conditioned  upon the tender of any minimum number of Shares.  The
          Fund is not required to accept or pay for any Shares  tendered.  Under
          certain  circumstances,  the Fund may  terminate or amend its Offer or
          postpone  the  acceptance  of the Shares for  payment.  See  Section 5
          "Certain Conditions of the Offer."

     o    IF I DECIDE  NOT TO TENDER  MY  SHARES,  HOW WILL THE OFFER  AFFECT MY
          SHARES?  If you do not  tender  your  Shares,  you may be  subject  to
          certain risks  resulting  from the Fund reducing its assets to pay for
          tendered  Shares.  These risks  include  increased  volatility  in the
          Fund's NAV and higher  expenses.  These risks should be reduced to the
          extent that the Fund sells new Shares.  See Section 7 "Certain Effects
          of the Offer."

     o    WHO SHOULD I CALL IF I NEED MORE  INFORMATION?  Questions and requests
          for  assistance  may be  directed to your  financial  advisor or other
          nominee,  or to the Transfer Agent at the address and telephone number
          set forth  below.  Requests  for  additional  copies of this  Offer to
          Purchase  and the  Letter of  Transmittal  should be  directed  to the

     Hyperion  Strategic Bond Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is offering to purchase up
to 292,825 of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.001
per share (the  "Shares"),  for cash at a price  equal to their net asset  value
("NAV") as of the close of business on the New York Stock  Exchange on Thursday,
September 30, 2004, the Expiration  Date,  unless  extended,  upon the terms and
conditions  set forth in this Offer to Purchase  (the  "Offer")  and the related
Letter of  Transmittal.  The Shares are not currently  traded on an  established
secondary market. The NAV on July 30, 2004 was $6.83 per Share.

     If more  than  292,825  Shares of the Fund are duly  tendered  prior to the
expiration  of  the  Offer,  assuming  no  changes  in  the  factors  originally
considered  by the Fund's  Board of  Directors  when it  determined  to make the
Offer,  the Fund will  either (1) extend its Offer  period,  if  necessary,  and
increase the number of Shares that the Fund is offering to purchase to an amount
which it believes will be sufficient to accommodate the excess Shares  tendered,
as well as any Shares tendered during the extended Offer period, or (2) purchase
the Shares tendered on a pro rata basis.

         THE FUND'S OFFER IS BEING MADE TO ALL STOCKHOLDERS OF THE FUND

     If you  desire to tender  all or any  portion  of your  Shares,  you should

nominee  to  effect  the  transaction  for you,  or (2) if you own  your  Shares
directly, complete and sign the Fund's Letter of Transmittal and mail or deliver
it along with any Share  certificate(s)  and any other required documents to the
Fund's  Transfer  Agent.  If your Shares are registered in the name of a broker,
dealer,  commercial bank, trust company or other nominee,  you must contact such
broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee if you desire to
tender your Shares.

     NEITHER THE FUND NOR ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS,  MAKES ANY  RECOMMENDATION  TO
ANY STOCKHOLDER AS TO WHETHER TO TENDER OR REFRAIN FROM TENDERING  SHARES.  EACH
STOCKHOLDER MUST MAKE HIS OR HER OWN DECISION  WHETHER TO TENDER SHARES,  AND IF
SO, HOW MAY SHARES TO TENDER.

FUND AS TO WHETHER  STOCKHOLDERS  SHOULD TENDER SHARES PURSUANT TO THE OFFER. NO
PERSON  HAS  BEEN   AUTHORIZED   TO  GIVE  ANY   INFORMATION   OR  TO  MAKE  ANY
REPRESENTATIONS  IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINED  HEREIN

     1.  Price;  Number of Shares.  The Fund will  purchase up to 292,825 of its
issued and outstanding Shares which are tendered and not withdrawn prior to 4:00
p.m.,  Eastern time, on September 30, 2004 (such time and date being hereinafter
called the "Initial  Expiration  Date")  unless it  determines to accept none of
them. The Fund reserves the right to extend its Offer. See Section 13 "Extension
of Tender Period; Termination;  Amendments." The later of the Initial Expiration
Date or the latest time and date to which an Offer is  extended  is  hereinafter
called the  "Expiration  Date." The purchase  price of the Fund's Shares will be
its NAV as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Expiration Date.

     The Fund's Offer is being made to all  stockholders  of the Fund and is not
conditioned  upon any  minimum  number of Shares  being  tendered.  If more than
292,825 Shares are duly tendered prior to the expiration of the Offer,  assuming
no changes in the factors originally considered by the Fund's Board of Directors
when it determined to make the Offer,  the Fund will either (1) extend its Offer
period,  if  necessary,  and  increase  the  number of  Shares  that the Fund is
offering to  purchase  to an amount  which it  believes  will be  sufficient  to
accommodate the excess Shares tendered as well as any Shares tendered during the
extended Offer period, or (2) purchase the Shares on a pro rata basis.


<page>


     As of June 30, 2004 there were approximately  20,297,543.329 million Shares
issued and outstanding and there were 111 holders of record of Shares.  The Fund
has been informed that none of the Directors, officers or affiliates of the Fund
intends to tender any Shares  pursuant to the Offer.  The Fund's  Shares are not
currently traded on any established secondary market.

     2. Procedure for Tendering  Shares.  In order for you to tender any of your
Shares, you may either: (a) request your broker, dealer,  commercial bank, trust
company  or other  nominee to effect the  transaction  for you,  in which case a
Letter of  Transmittal  is not required,  or (b) if the Shares are registered in
your name,  send the  Transfer  Agent,  at the  address set forth on page 5, any
certificate(s)  for such Shares,  a properly  completed  and executed  Letter of
Transmittal  for the Fund  and any  other  required  documents.  Please  contact
Jennifer  Donovan at (877)  248-6417 for any  additional  document  which may be
required.

A. Procedures for Beneficial Owners Holding Shares Through Brokers or Nominees.

     If your Shares are registered in the name of a broker,  dealer,  commercial
bank,  trust  company or other  nominee,  you must contact such broker,  dealer,
commercial  bank,  trust  company or other  nominee if you desire to tender your
Shares. You should contact such broker,  dealer,  commercial bank, trust company
or other nominee in  sufficient  time to permit  notification  of your desire to
tender  to  reach  the  Transfer  Agent by the  Expiration  Date.  No  brokerage
commission will be charged on the purchase of Shares by the Fund pursuant to the
Offer.  However,  a  broker  or  dealer  may  charge  a fee for  processing  the
transaction on your behalf.

B.  Procedures for Registered Stockholders.

     If you will be mailing or delivering a Letter of Transmittal  and any other
required  documents to the Transfer  Agent in order to tender your Shares,  they
must be received on or prior to the Expiration Date by the Transfer Agent at its
address set forth on page 5 of this Offer to Purchase.

     Signature on a Letter of Transmittal MUST be guaranteed by a member firm of
a registered national securities exchange, or a commercial bank or trust company
having an  office,  branch or agency in the United  States,  the  existence  and
validity  of which may be  verified  by the  Transfer  Agent  through the use of
industry publications. Notarized signatures are not sufficient.

     Payment for Shares  tendered and purchased  will be made only after receipt
by the Transfer Agent on or before the Expiration  Date of a properly  completed
and duly executed  Letter of Transmittal  and any other required  documents.  If
your Shares are  evidenced  by  certificates,  those  certificates  also must be
received by the Transfer Agent on or prior to the Expiration Date.

     The method of delivery of any documents, including certificates for shares,
is at the election and risk of the party tendering the shares.  If documents are
sent by mail,  it is  recommended  that they sent by registered  mail,  properly
insured, with return receipt requested.

C.  Determinations of Validity.

     All  questions as to the validity,  form,  eligibility  (including  time of
receipt) and  acceptance  of tenders will be determined by the Fund, in its sole
discretion,  whose determination  shall be final and binding.  The Fund reserves
the absolute  right to reject any or all tenders  determined  by it not to be in
appropriate form or the acceptance of or payment for which would, in the opinion
of counsel for the Fund, be unlawful.  The Fund also reserves the absolute right
to waive any of the  conditions  of the Offer or any defect in any  tender  with
respect to any particular Shares or any particular  stockholder,  and the Fund's
interpretations  of the terms  and  conditions  of its  Offer  will be final and
binding. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in connection with tenders
must be cured within such times as the Fund shall determine. Tenders will not be
deemed to have been made until the defects or irregularities  have been cured or
waived.  Neither the Fund,  the  administrator  for the Fund,  Hyperion  Capital
Management,  Inc. ("HCM"), nor the Transfer Agent, nor any other person shall be
obligated to give notice of any defects or irregularities, nor shall any of them
incur any liability for failure to give such notice.

D.  Tender Constitutes an Agreement.

     A tender of Shares  made  pursuant to any one of the  procedures  set forth
above will  constitute an agreement  between the tendering  stockholder  and the
Fund  in  accordance  with  the  terms  and  subject  to the  conditions  of the
applicable Offer.

     3. Withdrawal Rights. You may withdraw Shares tendered at any time prior to
the Expiration Date and, if the Shares have not been accepted for payment by the
Fund, at any time after October 28, 2004.

     Stockholders  whose  accounts  are  maintained   through  broker,   dealer,
commercial  bank,  trust  company,  or other nominee  should notify such nominee
prior  to the  Expiration  Date.  Stockholders  whose  accounts  are  maintained
directly through the Transfer Agent should submit written notice to the Transfer
Agent.

     To be effective,  any notice of withdrawal  must be timely  received by the
Transfer Agent at the address set forth on page 5 of this Offer to Purchase. Any
notice of withdrawal  must specify the name of the person  having  deposited the
Shares to be  withdrawn,  the  number of Shares  to be  withdrawn,  and,  if any
certificate representing such Shares have been delivered or otherwise identified
to the Transfer  Agent,  the name of the registered  holder(s) of such Shares as
set forth in such certificates and the number of Shares to be withdrawn.  If any
certificates  have been  delivered to the  Transfer  Agent,  then,  prior to the
release of such certificate,  you must also submit the certificate numbers shown
on the particular  certificates  evidencing such Shares and the signature on the
notice of the  withdrawal  must be  guaranteed by an eligible  institution.  All
questions as to the form and validity  (including time of receipt) of notices of
withdrawal  will  be  determined  by the  Fund  in its  sole  discretion,  whose
determination  shall be final and binding.  Shares properly  withdrawn shall not
thereafter  be  deemed  to be  tendered  for  purposes  of the  Offer.  However,
withdrawn Shares may be tendered by following one of the procedures described in
Section 2 "Procedure for Tendering Shares."

     4. Payment for Shares.  For purposes of its Offer,  the Fund will be deemed
to have  accepted  for  payment  (and  thereby  purchased)  its Shares  that are
tendered as, if and when it give oral or written notice to the Transfer Agent of
its election to purchase such Shares.

     Payment for Shares will be made promptly by the Transfer Agent to tendering
stockholders as directed by the Fund. Any  certificates for Shares not purchased
(see Section 1 "Price;  Number of Shares" and Section 5 "Certain  Conditions  of
the Offer"),  or for Shares not tendered  included in certificates  forwarded to
the  Transfer  Agent,  will be  returned  promptly  following  the  termination,
expiration or withdrawal of the relevant Offer, without expense to the tendering
stockholder.

     The Fund will pay all transfer taxes, if any, payable on the transfer to it
of its Shares purchased pursuant to its Offer. If any tendered  certificates are
registered in the name of any person other than the person signing the Letter of
Transmittal,  the  amount of any such  transfer  taxes  (whether  imposed on the
registered  holder or such other  person)  payable on account of the transfer to
such  person  will be  deducted  from the  purchase  price  unless  satisfactory
evidence of the payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is submitted. The
Fund will not pay any interest on the purchase price under any circumstances.

     5.  Certain  Conditions  of the Offer.  The Fund shall not be  required  to
accept for payment or pay for any of its Shares  tendered,  and may terminate or
amend its Offer or may postpone the  acceptance  for payment of, or payment for,
its Shares tendered,  if: (1) such purchases would impair the Fund's status as a
regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code")  (which would cause the Fund's  income to be taxed at the corporate
level in addition to the taxation of stockholders who receive dividends from the
Fund);  (2) the Fund would not be able to liquidate  portfolio  securities  in a
manner which is orderly and consistent with the Fund's investment  objective and
policies in order to enable the Fund to purchase Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer;  or (3)  there is, in the  Board of  Director's  judgment,  any (a) legal
action or proceeding instituted or threatened challenging the Offer or otherwise
materially adversely affecting the Fund, (b) declaration of a banking moratorium
by Federal or state  authorities  or any  suspension  of payment by banks in the
United States or New York State,  which is material to the Fund,  (c) limitation
imposed by Federal or state  authorities  on the  extension of credit by lending
institutions,  (d) commencement of war, armed hostilities,  acts of terrorism or
other  international or national calamity  directly or indirectly  involving the
United  States,  which is material to the Fund,  or (e) other event or condition
which would have a material  adverse effect on the Fund or its  stockholders  if
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer were purchased.

     If the Fund determines to amend its Offer or to postpone the acceptance for
payment of or payment for Shares  tendered,  it will,  to the extent  necessary,
extend the period of time during which the Offer is open. Moreover, in the event
any of the  foregoing  conditions  are modified or waived in whole or in part at
any time, the Fund will promptly make a public  announcement  of such waiver and
may,  depending on the  materiality of the  modification  or waiver,  extend the
Offer  period.  See  Section  13  "Extension  of  Tender  Period;   Termination;
Amendments."

     6. Purpose of the Offer.  Currently  there is no  secondary  market for the
Fund's Shares.  The Fund's Board of Directors has determined that it would be in
the best  interest  of  stockholders  for the Fund to take  action to attempt to
provide liquidity to stockholders.  The Fund will not at any time be required to
make tender offers in the future.

     7. Certain  Effects of the Offer.  The  purchase of Shares  pursuant to the
Fund's Offer will have the effect of increasing  the  proportionate  interest in
the Fund of  stockholders  who do not tender  their  Shares.  If you retain your
Shares, however, you will be subject to any increased risks that may result from
the  reduction in the Fund's  aggregate  assets  resulting  from payment for the
Shares,  including,  for example,  the potential for greater  volatility  due to
decreased  diversification and higher expenses.  However, the Fund believes that
those  risks will be  reduced  to the  extent  new  Shares are sold.  All Shares
purchased by the Fund  pursuant to its Offer will be retired by the Fund's Board
of Directors.

     8. Source and Amount of Funds.  The price to be paid by the Fund for Shares
tendered  in its Offer  will equal its NAV as of the close of the New York Stock
Exchange  on the  Expiration  Date.  Based  on the NAV on  July  30,  2004,  the
aggregate  purchase  price if (i) 292,825  Shares are  tendered and accepted for
payment will be approximately  $2,000,000 million. The Fund anticipates that the
purchase  price for shares  acquired  by the Fund  pursuant  to its Offer may be
derived by the Fund from (i) cash on hand,  (ii) the  proceeds  from the sale of
cash  equivalents  held by the Fund,  (iii) the  proceeds of sales of  portfolio
investments held by the Fund, and /or (iv) borrowings by the Fund.

     The Fund has sufficient cash to purchase the tendered  shares;  however the
Fund may borrow all or part of the funds  necessary to complete the tender offer
by executing a 90 day reverse  repurchase  agreement between the Fund and Morgan
Stanley and Company. The collateral for the agreement would consist of a portion
of a Credit Suisse First Boston  2003-C5 A2 bond,  and the rate of the agreement
would be set at LIBOR plus 10 basis points.  The Fund would  continue to finance
the reverse repurchase agreement, which is consistent with the Fund's investment
strategy.

     Under  the 1940  Act,  the  Fund  may not  declare  any  dividend  or other
distribution  upon any class of its capital stock,  or purchase any such capital
stock,  unless  the  aggregate  indebtedness  of the Fund has at the time of the
declaration  of any such  dividend  or  distribution  or at the time of any such
purchase  an asset  coverage of at least 300% for the Fund after  deducting  the
amount of such dividend,  distribution,  or purchase  price, as the case may be.
Also,  certain  types of  borrowings  by the Fund may  result in the Fund  being
subject to  covenants  in credit  agreements,  including  those  relating to the
Fund's  asset  coverage  and  portfolio   composition   requirements  and  those
restricting the Fund's payment of dividends and distributions.

     9. Financial Information.  Comprehensive  financial information is included
in the  Fund's  financial  statements,  copies of which have been filed with the
Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC") and are  incorporated  herein by
reference.  You may request a copy the Fund's Annual  Reports or the Fund's 2004
Semi-Annual Report at no charge by calling  1-800-HYPERION between 8:30 a.m. and
5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on any business day.


     10. Certain Information About the Fund.

     The Fund  was  incorporated  under  the laws of the  State of  Maryland  on
September 12, 1995 and is a non-diversified,  closed-end,  management investment
company registered under the 1940 Act.

     The  Fund's  investment  objective  is to  provide  high  total  return  by
investing, under normal circumstances,  at least 65% of its assets in securities
backed by  interests  in real estate.  The  investment  objective of the Fund is
fundamental and may not be changed without  approval by the holders of more than
75% of the shares of the Fund's common stock. No assurance can be given that the
Fund's  objective  will be  achieved.  Like all  investors  in interest  bearing
securities,  the Fund is  exposed  to the risk  that the  prices  of  individual
securities held by the portfolio may fluctuate, in some cases significantly,  in
response  to changes in credit  conditions  and  prevailing  levels of  interest
rates.  At least 80% of the Fund's  assets are invested in debt.  This policy is
not  fundamental  and can be  changed  with at least  60 days  prior  notice  to
shareholders.

     There have not been any transactions  involving the Fund's Shares that were
effected  during the past 60 business days by any executive  officer or Director
of the Fund, by any person  controlling  the Fund,  by any executive  officer or
director  of  any  corporation  ultimately  in  control  of the  Fund  or by any
associate or subsidiary of any of the foregoing  including any executive officer
or director of any such  subsidiary.  On July 1, 2004,  the Virginia  Retirement
System  purchased  4,016,064.257  Shares  from the Fund at a price of $7.47  per
Share.

     The  principal  executive  offices of the Fund are  located at One  Liberty
Plaza, 165 Broadway, 36th Floor, New York, NY 10006-1404.

     11.  Additional  Information.  The Fund has  filed an issuer  tender  offer
statement  on  Schedule  TO  with  the SEC  which  includes  certain  additional
information  relating to its Offer. Such material may be inspected and copied at
prescribed  rates at the SEC's public  reference  facilities at Judiciary Plaza,
450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such material may also
be obtained by mail at prescribed  rates from the Public Reference Branch of the
SEC at 450 Fifth Street,  N.W.,  Washington,  DC 20549.  The SEC maintains a web
site  (http://www.sec.gov)  that  contains  the  Fund's  Schedule  TO and  other
information regarding the Fund.

     12. Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences.  The following discussion is a
general  summary  of the  Federal  income tax  consequences  of a sale of Shares
pursuant to the Offer.  You should  consult  your own tax advisor for a complete
description of the tax  consequences  to you of a sale of Shares pursuant to the
Offer.

     The sale of Shares pursuant to the Offer will be a taxable  transaction for
Federal  income tax  purposes,  either as a "sale or exchange," or under certain
circumstances, as a "dividend." In general, the transaction should be treated as
a sale or exchange of the Shares under  Section 302 of the Code,  if the receipt
of cash (a) is "substantially disproportionate" with respect to the stockholder,
(b) results in a "complete redemption" of the stockholder's  interest, or (c) is
"not essentially  equivalent to a dividend" with respect to the  stockholder.  A
"substantially  disproportionate" distribution generally requires a reduction of
at least 20% in the stockholder's  proportionate  interest in the Fund after all
shares  are  tendered.  A  "complete  redemption"  of a  stockholder's  interest
generally  requires that all Shares of the Fund directly  owned or attributed to
such  stockholder  under Section 318 of the Code be disposed of. A  distribution
"not essentially  equivalent to a dividend" requires that there be a "meaningful
reduction" in the  stockholder's  interest in the Fund, which should be the case
if the stockholder has a minimal interest in the Fund, exercises no control over
Fund affairs and suffers a reduction in his proportionate interest in the Fund.

     If the sale of your  Shares  meets  any of these  three  tests for "sale or
exchange"  treatment,  you will  recognize  gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of cash  received  pursuant to the Offer and the adjusted tax
basis of the Shares  sold.  Such gain or loss will be a capital  gain or loss if
the Shares sold have been held by you as a capital  asset.  In general,  capital
gain or loss with respect to Shares sold will be long-term  capital gain or loss
if the holding period for such Shares is more than one year. The maximum capital
gains  rate  currently  applicable  to such a sale of  Shares  would  be 15% for
individuals.

     If none of the Code  Section 302 tests  described  above is met, you may be
treated as having received,  in whole or in part, a dividend,  return of capital
or capital  gain,  depending on (i) whether  there are  sufficient  earnings and
profits to support a dividend  and (ii) your tax basis in the  relevant  Shares.
The tax basis in the  Shares  tendered  to the Fund will be  transferred  to any
remaining  Shares held by you in the Fund.  In  addition,  if the sale of Shares
pursuant to the Offer is treated as a "dividend" to a tendering  stockholder,  a
constructive  dividend under Code Section  305(c) may result to a  non-tendering
stockholder whose proportionate  interest in the earnings and assets of the Fund
has been increased as a result of such tender.

     Accordingly,  the differentiation between "dividend" and "sale or exchange"
treatment  can be important  with respect to the amount and  character of income
that tendering  stockholders are deemed to receive. While the marginal tax rates
for dividends and capital gains remain the same for corporate stockholders,  the
top income tax rate applicable to ordinary income  dividends of the Fund paid to
individual  shareholders currently exceeds the maximum tax rate on capital gains
(15%).

     The gross  proceeds  paid to a stockholder  or other payee  pursuant to the
Offer will be subject to a withholding  tax unless either:  (a) the  stockholder
has provided the stockholder's  taxpayer  identification  number/social security
number, and certifies under penalty of perjury: (i) that such number is correct,
and (ii) either that (A) the stockholder is exempt from backup withholding,  (B)
the stockholder is not otherwise subject to backup  withholding as a result of a
failure to report all interest or dividends, or (C) the Internal Revenue Service
has notified the stockholder that the stockholder is no longer subject to backup
withholding;  or (b) an  exception  applies  under  applicable  law and Treasury
regulations.  Foreign stockholders may be required to provide the Transfer Agent
with a completed  Form W-8BEN,  available from the Transfer  Agent,  in order to
avoid backup withholding.

     Unless  a  reduced  rate  of  withholding  or a  withholding  exemption  is
available  under an applicable  tax treaty,  a stockholder  who is a nonresident
alien or a foreign entity may be subject to a 30% United States  withholding tax
on the gross proceeds received by such stockholder,  if the proceeds are treated
as a "dividend" under the rules described  above.  Foreign  stockholders  should
consult their tax advisers regarding application of these withholding rules.

     13. Extension of Tender Period; Termination;  Amendments. The Fund reserves
the  right,  at any time and from  time to time,  to extend  the  period of time
during  which its Offer is  pending  by making  an  announcement  thereof.  Such
announcement  will be issued no later than 9:00 a.m.,  Eastern time, on the next
business day after the previously  scheduled  Expiration  Date and will disclose
the approximate number of relevant Shares tendered as of that date. In the event
that the Fund elects to extend its Offer  period,  the NAV for the Fund's Shares
tendered  will be  determined  as of the close of business of the New York Stock
Exchange on the Expiration  Date, as extended.  During any such  extension,  all
Shares previously tendered and not purchased or withdrawn will remain subject to
the Fund's Offer. The Fund also reserves the right, at any time and from time to
time up to and including the Expiration Date, to (a) terminate its Offer and not
to  purchase  or pay for any  Shares,  and (b) amend  its Offer in any  respect,
including but not limited to,  amending the number of its Shares  subject to its
Offer. If a material change is made to the terms of the relevant Offer, the Fund
will promptly make a public  announcement of any such change.  Without  limiting
the  manner in which the Fund may  choose  to make a public  announcement  of an
extension,  termination  or  amendment  of the  Offer,  except  as  provided  by
applicable law (including Rule 13e-4(e)(2) under the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934),  the Fund shall have no  obligation  to publish,  advertise  or otherwise
communicate any such public announcement, other than by making a press release.

     14.  Miscellaneous.  The Offer is not being  made to,  nor will  tenders be
accepted  from,  stockholders  in any  jurisdiction  in which  each Offer or its
acceptance would not comply with the securities laws of such  jurisdiction.  The
Fund is not aware of any  jurisdiction  in which its Offer or  tenders  pursuant
thereto would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction.  However,
the Fund  reserves  the  right to  exclude  stockholders  from its  Offer in any
jurisdiction in which it is asserted that the Offer cannot lawfully be made. The
Fund believes such exclusion is permissible under applicable tender offer rules,
provided  the Fund makes a good faith effort to comply with any state law deemed
applicable to its Offer.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The  undersigned  hereby tenders to Hyperion  Strategic Bond Fund,  Inc., a
closed-end  investment  company  incorporated  under  the  laws of the  State of
Maryland (the "Fund"), the shares described above of its common stock, par value
$.001 per share  (the  "Shares"),  at a price  equal to the net asset  value per
Share  ("NAV")  calculated  on the  Expiration  Date (as defined in the Offer to
Purchase),  in cash,  upon the  terms and  conditions  set forth in the Offer to
Purchase dated August 31, 2004, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged,  and in
this Letter of Transmittal (which together constitute the "Offer").

     The  undersigned  hereby sells to the Fund all Shares  tendered hereby that
are  purchased  pursuant  to the Offer and hereby  irrevocably  constitutes  and
appoints the Transfer  Agent as attorney in fact of the  undersigned,  with full
power of substitution  (such power of attorney being deemed to be an irrevocable
power coupled with an interest), to present such Shares and any applicable Share
certificates   for  cancellation  of  such  Shares  on  the  Fund's  books.  The
undersigned  hereby warrants that the undersigned has full authority to sell the
Shares tendered  hereby and that the Fund will acquire good title thereto,  free
and clear of all liens, charges,  encumbrances,  conditional sales agreements or
other obligations  relating to the sale thereof,  and not subject to any adverse
claim,  when and to the extent the same are purchased by it. Upon  request,  the
undersigned  will  execute and deliver any  additional  documents  necessary  to
complete the sale in accordance with the terms of the Offer.

     The undersigned  recognizes that under certain  circumstances  set forth in
the Offer to  Purchase,  the Fund may not be  required  to  purchase  any of the
Shares tendered hereby. In that event, the undersigned  understands that, in the
case of Shares  evidenced  by  certificates,  certificate(s)  for any Shares not
purchased will be returned to the undersigned at the address indicated above. In
the case of Shares  not  evidenced  by  certificates  and held in an  investment
account,  the Transfer  Agent will cancel the tender order and no Shares will be
withdrawn from the account.

     All authority  herein conferred or agreed to be conferred shall survive the
death or incapacity of the  undersigned  and the  obligation of the  undersigned
hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs, personal representatives,  successors
and assigns of the  undersigned.  Except as stated in the Offer,  this tender is

executed  Letter of  Transmittal,  should be mailed or delivered to the Transfer
Agent on or prior to the Expiration Date at the appropriate  address as noted on
the bottom on the last page herein and must be received  by the  Transfer  Agent
prior to the Expiration  Date. The method of delivery of all documents is at the
election and risk of the tendering stockholder.

     3.  Inadequate  Space.  If the space provided is inadequate,  the number of
Shares should be listed on a separate signed schedule attached hereto.

     4.  Partial  Tenders.  If fewer than all of the  Shares in your  investment
account or evidenced by any  certificate  submitted are to be tendered,  fill in
the number of Shares  which are to be  tendered in the column  entitled  "No. of
Shares  Tendered." If  applicable,  a new  certificate  for the remainder of the
Shares  evidenced  by  your  old  certificate(s)  will be sent to you as soon as
practicable  after the Expiration Date of the Offer.  All Shares  represented by
certificate(s)  listed or in your  investment  account  are  deemed to have been
tendered unless otherwise indicated.

     5. Signatures on Letter of Transmittal, Authorization and Endorsements.

          (a) If the Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder of
     the Shares  tendered  hereby,  the  signatures(s)  must correspond with the
     name(s) in which the Shares are  registered.  (b) If the Shares are held of
     record by two or more joint holders, all such holders must sign this Letter
     of Transmittal.

          (c) If any tendered  Shares are registered in different  names it will
     be  necessary  to  complete,  sign and submit as many  separate  Letters of
     Transmittal as there are different registrations of Shares.

          (d) When this  Letter  of  Transmittal  is  signed  by the  registered
     holder(s)  of the Shares  listed and, if  applicable,  of the  certificates
     transmitted   hereby,   no   endorsements   of   certificates  or  separate
     authorizations are required.

          (e)  If  this   Letter  of   Transmittal   or  any   certificates   or
     authorizations   are  signed  by   trustees,   executors,   administrators,
     guardians,  attorneys in fact, officers of corporations or others acting in
     a fiduciary or  representative  capacity,  such persons  should so indicate
     when signing,  and must submit proper evidence  satisfactory to the Fund of
     their authority so to act.

     6. Transfer Taxes.  The Fund will pay all the taxes, if any, payable on the
transfer  to  it  of  Shares  purchased  pursuant  to  the  Offer.  If  tendered
certificates  are  registered in the name of any person other than the person(s)
signing this Letter of  Transmittal,  the amount of any transfer  taxes (whether
imposed on the registered holder or such other person) payable on account of the
transfer  to such  person  will be  deducted  from  the  purchase  price  unless
satisfactory  evidence of the payment of such taxes or  exemption  therefrom  is
submitted.

     7.  Irregularities.  All  questions as to the validity,  form,  eligibility
(including  time of  receipt)  and  acceptance  of any tender of Shares  will be
determined  by the Fund in its sole  discretion,  whose  determination  shall be
final and binding.  The Fund  reserves  the absolute  right to reject any or all
tenders  determined by it not to be in appropriate  form or the acceptance of or
payment for which  would,  in the opinion of counsel for the Fund,  be unlawful.
The Fund also reserves the absolute  right to waive any of the conditions of the
Offer or any defect in any tender with respect to any  particular  Shares or any
particular  stockholder,  and  the  Fund's  interpretations  of  the  terms  and
conditions  of the  Offer  (including  these  instructions)  will be  final  and
binding. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in connection with tenders
must be cured within such time as the Fund shall determine.  Tenders will not be
deemed to have been made until all defects and irregularities have been cured or
waived. Neither the Fund, Hyperion Capital Management, Inc., the Transfer Agent,
nor  any  other  person  shall  be  obligated  to  give  notice  of  defects  or
irregularities in tenders, nor shall any of them incur any liability for failure
to give any such notice.

     8. Important Tax  Information.  Under Federal income tax law, a stockholder
whose tendered Shares are accepted for payment is required by law to provide the
Transfer Agent (as payer) with his correct taxpayer identification number, which
is accomplished by completing and signing the Signature Form.

This announcement is not an offer to purchase or solicitation of offers to sell
Shares. The Offer is made only by the Offer to Purchase dated August 31, 2004,
and the related Letter of Transmittal. The Offer is not being made to, nor will
tenders be accepted from or on behalf of, holders of Shares in any jurisdiction
in which making or accepting the Offer would violate that jurisdiction's laws.



                       Hyperion Strategic Bond Fund, Inc.

                      Notice of Offer to Purchase for Cash
                  292,825 of its Issued and Outstanding Shares
                          at Net Asset Value Per Share

                          -----------------------------



 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          THE EXPIRATION DATE AND THE WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE FOR THE OFFER
   is 4:00 p.m., EASTERN TIME ON THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, UNLESS EXTENDED.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     Hyperion  Strategic Bond Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is offering to purchase up
to 292,825 of its issued and outstanding  shares of common stock par value $.001
per share (the "Shares") at a price equal to their net asset value ("NAV") as of
the close of business on the New York Stock  Exchange  on the  Expiration  Date,
September 30, 2004, unless extended,  upon the terms and conditions set forth in
the Offer to Purchase dated August 31, 2004 (the  "Offer").  The NAV on July 30,
was $6.83 per Share.

     The  purpose  of  the  Offer  is  to  provide   liquidity   to  the  Fund's
stockholders,  since the Fund's shares are not sold on a secondary  market.  The
Offer is not conditioned upon the tender of any minimum number of Shares.

     If more than 292,825  Shares are duly tendered  prior to the  expiration of
the Offer assuming no changes in the factors originally considered by the Fund's
Board of Directors  when it determined  to make the Offer,  the Fund will either
(1) extend its Offer  period,  if  necessary,  and increase the number of Shares
that the Fund is offering to  purchase  to an amount  which it believes  will be
sufficient  to  accommodate  the excess Shares  tendered,  as well as any Shares
tendered  during the extended Offer period,  or (2) purchase  292,825 Shares (or
such larger number of Shares sought), on a pro rata basis.

     Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to
4:00 p.m.,  Eastern time on Thursday,  September  30, 2004,  unless the offer is
extended,  and, if not yet accepted for payment by the Fund,  Shares may also be
withdrawn after October 28, 2004.

     The information  required to be disclosed by paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 13e-4
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is contained in the Offer
to Purchase and is incorporated herein by reference.

     The Offer to Purchase and the related  Letter of  Transmittal  for the Fund
contain important  information that should be read carefully before any decision
is made with respect to the Offer.

     Questions  and  requests  for  assistance  or for  copies  of the  Offer to
Purchase,  the  Fund's  Letter  of  Transmittal,  and  any  other  tender  offer
documents,  may be  directed to  Jennifer  Donovan at the address and  telephone
number  below.  Copies will be furnished  promptly at no expense to you and also
may be obtained by completing  and returning the coupon below to American  Stock
Transfer & Trust.
